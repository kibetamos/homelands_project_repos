        "judgement": [
            "J U D G M E N T",
            "1.  The dispute giving rise to these three appeals was over the application by the Appellant to be registered as the registered owner of Trade mark [THERMOS] (word).  The Application was dated 12/7/2006.  After an initial rejection, on the basis that it was identical to a registered Trade Mark No. 17003 belonging to THERMOS LTD, the application was subsequently approved after the Trade Mark No. 17003 was removed from the Register due to non-renewal by the registered owner.  In terms of the law the removal was published in the Industrial Property Journal of 31/5/2009 and the approval itself published in the same journal on 30/11/2010.",
            "2.  Upon the publication, the respondent then made a request for the restoration of the mark to the register on the basis that it had been assigned to THERMOS KK who subsequently assigned and transferred it to the respondent and that the statutory notices leading to the removal had been misaddressed and were thus invalid and the removal a nullity.",
            "3. Upon the request, the registrar restored the name of the respondent as the registered proprietor of the mark on the basis that the renewal notices had not been sent to the registered proprietor. That was on the 11/01/2011.  Armed with the new found footing of being the registered proprietor, the respondent then lodged a Notice of Objection to the appellant’s application for registration and prayed that the same be refused.  That notice of opposition was itself opposed by the Appellant by a counter-statement urging the rejection of the notice of opposition.  It is the determination of the Notice of opposition which aggrieved the appellant and provoked this appeal in which the appellant seeks orders that:-",
            "“5. This appeal be and hereby allowed and the decision and ruling of the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks, Elvine Apiyo, delivered on 24th October 2017 in THE MATTER OF T.M.A. NO. 59464 “THERMOS” (WORD) IN CLASS 21 IN THE NAME OF DOSHI IRON MONGERS LIMITED AND OPPOSITION THERETO BY THERMOS HONG KONG LIMITED be and is hereby set aside in its entirety.",
            "6. All consequential proceedings emanating from the ruling delivered by the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks, Elvine Apiyo, on 24th October 2017 THE MATTER OF T.M.A. NO. 59464 “THERMOS” (WORD) IN CLASS 21 IN THE NAME OF DOSHI IRON MONGERS LIMITED AND OPPOSITION THERETO BY THERMOS HONG KONG LIMITED be and is hereby stayed permanently.",
            "7. There be and is hereby issued an order of permanent injunction to restrain the Respondent, its agents, employees, assigns or any other person acting on the Respondent’s behalf from using, dealing in and/or trading in Trade Mark Number 17003 known as “Thermos” in Class 21.",
            "8. The Certificate of Registration of Assignment and the Certificate of Renewal of Trade Mark Number 17003 known as “Thermos” in Class 21 issued in favour of the Respondent, THERMOS HONG KONG LIMITED be and are hereby revoked forthwith.",
            "9. There be and is hereby issued an order to compel the Registrar of Trade Marks to issue to the Appellant a Certificate of Registration of Trade Mark Number 17003 known as “THERMOS” in Class 21 pursuant to the Appellant’s application No. KE/T/2006/0059464”.",
            "4.  The grounds of the appeal advanced are four and fashioned that the Assistant Registrar erred in:-",
            "i. Failing to appreciate that the Respondent had no locus standi to lodge the opposition because it was not the registered owner of the trite mark and could not be.",
            "ii. In upholding her decision to restore the respondent as the registered proprietor of the mark the Registrar failed to appreciate the law and thus erred in that a restoration is only available to the person who was the registered proprietor on the date of removal.",
            "iii. The counter statement was never considered by the Assistant Registrar and thus the Appellant was denied the right to be heard on the false basis that restoration was an administrative process which required no hearing of the Appellant.  Contrary to the decision and holding in Misc. Appl. No. 19 of 2011 (JR) REPUBLIC VS REGISTRAR OF TRIATE MARKS, EXPARTE DOSHI IRON MONGERS LTD.",
            "iv. There was an error of law on the part of the Assistant Registrar by making a decision tantamount to sitting on appeal one the decision of the Registrar in the letter dated 28/8/2009 was a refusal to restore and did not give room for a revisit. ",
            "5. Having been brought pursuant to Sections 21(6), 51 and 52 of the Trade Mark Act as well as Rule 117, the Notice of Motion was supported by the Affidavit of one ASHOK LABAHSHANKER DOSHI which reiterated and elaborated on the grounds and exhibited documents to support the assertions.  The documents included the papers filed to argue the Notice of objection and counter statement and various correspondence exchange and the decision by Francis Tuiyot J in the Misc. Application No. 19 of 2011 (JR).  The proceedings and determination by the Assistant Registrar were equally exhibited.",
            "6. For the respondent two Replying Affidavits were filed sworn by ALEX HWANG the Chairman of the Respondent and another by Esther Kinjenje-Opiyo, the counsel for the Respondent.  The gist of the opposition to the appeal was that the trade mark THERMOS is currently registered in Kenya under six certificates with the respondent as the registered proprietor hence the Appellant being no registered owner cannot maintain an infringement suit and cannot seek and be granted an injunction pursuant to Section 5 & 7 of the Trademarks Act which given to the respondent the exclusive use of the marks as registered.  It was additionally contended that the notice leading to removal was invalid null and void and thus all acts undertaken on its strength including the removal were equally invalid and that the ruling of 28/8/2009 could not sanitize nor override the invalidity in the process.",
            "7.  It was then asserted that the impugned ruling merely corrected a fundamental error of sending an invalid notice and that the restoration was validly and legally done.  The contention as to the Locus standi of the respondent to lodge the Notice of opposition was said to be of no consequence because the issues regarding alleged winding up of Thermos Ltd was subject of the UK Law with no relevance to this matter as the restoration was validly done and relevant renewal and assignment certificates issued.  On the challenge on the renewal of the trademarks it was submitted that the same was time barred because the law dictates that an appeal to the high court be made within 60 days from the date of the decision which 11th & 14th January 2011.",
            "8.  A reiteration was made that, as the owner of the mark the respondent had all the right to pursue the notice and oppose the Application No. 59464 by the Appellant just as he had the rights to seek the extension of period for the opposition and that the determination by the Assistant Registrar was solid and unassailable because the name sought be registered was visually and phonetically identical to the respondent trade mark and if registered would not only confuse but also be a tool for passing-off goods bearing the mark.  The determination was hailed as sound and in line with Rules 64 and 70 of the Kenya Trade Mark Rules and was indeed upheld by the High Court in Misc. No. 19 of 2011 it being underscored that Section 14 of the Act Prohibit the registrar from registering any new trade mark that is likely to cause confusion or deception in the market.",
            "9. The certificates of use in legal proceedings respecting the Trade marks were exhibited together with registrar’s ruling dated 11/1/2011 and letters by the respondents counsel dated 8/11/2010 as well as that by the registrar dated 14/01/2011.  The Affidavit of counsel, Ms. Esther Kinyenje-Opiyo on its part contended that the appellant had failed to produce and avail to court the complete record of pleadings filed before the registrar and leading to the determination and therefore sought to remedy the default by exhibiting a document marked EWK being a copy of the first declaration and its exhibits.  The entire purpose of that Affidavit was to avail the said documents to be put on the record of this court.",
            "10. After the court concluded the interlocutory application regarding place of hearing the parties filed submission as well as supplementary submission as follows:-",
            "The appellant filed submissions dated 16/10/2018 and supplementary ones dated 29/7/2019.",
            "The respondent’s submissions are dated 7/12/2018 with supplementary ones dated 12/6/2019.",
            "11. A reading of the Affidavit filed, the decision by the Assistant registrar and submissions filed reveal that the issues the parties desire to be determined are as follows:-",
            "a. Whether the Respondent had the requisite locus standi to lodge the notice of opposition dated the 17/03/2017?",
            "b. Whether the restoration of the trade mark disclose an error of fact or law.",
            "c. Whether the appeal was time barred?",
            "d. Whether in failing to consider the appellants counter statement there was denial of the right to be heard?",
            "e. Whether in deciding the dispute as she did the Assistant Registrar sat on appeal over the decision of the Registrar.",
            "12. This is indeed a first appeal and the court is obligated comprehensively re-examined the entire record of the proceedings with a view to coming to own determination based on the facts as applied to the law.  On the issues isolated, I do consider issues no. a, c and d to challenge the propriety of the decision, not necessarily on the merits while ground (b) is on real merits based on the facts.",
            "13. I will thus start with the issues of competence of the decision regarding locus standi, lack of jurisdiction on the Assistant Registrar and the right to be heard in that order.",
            "Was the respondent clothed with locus standi to lodge and prosecute the Notice of Objection",
            "14. On this ground the appellant contends that the respondent lacked the requisite locus stand to object to its application for registration because the respondent was not the registered owner.  The contention is that the name of the respondent was irregularly entered into the register contrary to the law under the Trade Marks Act.",
            "15. To the appellant the two deeds of assignment dated 21/01/2002 and 25/10/2002, assigning the trade mark from THERMOS KK by thermos KK to the respondent could not anchor the respondent’s ownership because of being invalid for failure to comply with the law under Section 25(7), 28 and Rule 71.  According to the Appellant, those provisions demands that an assignment be advertised within six (6) months in as much as the assignment was never registered as required by the law.",
            "16. It was equally submitted that by the date the deed of assignment from thermos limited to Thermos KK was executed, thermos ltd had been wound up on 21/12/2001.  It was contended that a wound up company had no existence nor capacity to execute the deed of assignment.  In any event it is asserted that by the time thermos KK allegedly assigned its title to the respondent it was not the registered owner of the mark and had no capacity under Section 27 of the Act to purport to assign.",
            "17. It was then added that only a registered trade mark and not an expired one could be assigned after the same was removed from the register.  Moreover it was contended that the two deeds were lodge and payment of stamp duty effected simultaneously hence there was no compliance with the law because only a registered trade mark owner can assign.  There having been no advertisement of both deeds no title was passed to the respondent.",
            "18.  On this point, the respondent opposed the appeal by reliance upon Section 21(2) of the Act which afford to any person the right to lodge an objection.  In any event the respondent contended, and submitted that the validity of the opposition was determined by the High Court in Miscellaneous Application No. 19 of 2011 (JR).  It was additionally contended that the issue of locus standi has been raised for the first time an appeal and irregularly.",
            "19. By way of a rejoinder the appellant submitted that the issue of locus standi was indeed raised in the notice of motion in Ground A and urged at paragraph 12(a) to (g) and was thus not new.  In addition the appellant took the position that, the law, citing the decision in Ann Cherop Koech vs Charles Langat, [2018] eKLR an issue of law can be raised at any time even on appeal. In any event, the appellant argued, only the opponent and the registrar are not allowed to raise new issues on appeal under Section 21(a) of the Act.",
            "20. The answer to this ground of appeal even though the parties have made very elaborate and extensive submissions is not a difficult one.  It is not difficult because in law there is the doctrine or res judicata which mandates that no court of law can seek to adjudicate a matter that has been the subject of adjudication between the same parties by a court of competent jurisdiction.",
            "21. In this matter, the propriety or competence of the notice of opposition was at the core and centre of the determination by Judge Tuiyot.  He considered the point at length and determined in his determination of 5/10/2012 in JR No. 19 of 2011, that there was a valid opposition filed.  The judge said:-",
            "“Ultimately the restoration decision is unchallenged and intact and there is a valid opposition lodged to Doshi’s application.  The stage is now set for the remainder of the opposition proceedings.  This court cannot stop the respondent from carrying out its statutory duties.  The respondent is obliged in law to process the opposition”.",
            "22. The judge of a competent and concurrent jurisdiction having so delivered himself and his decision having not been challenged on appeal, I do find that I am prohibited by Section 7 of Civil Procedure Act for purporting to revisit the issue.  In addition Section 21(2) of the Act allows ‘any person’ to give notice to the registrar of opposition to registration.  That ground lacks merits and is dismissed.",
            "Was the appellant accorded the right to be heard?",
            "23. On this point the appellant asserts that its counter statement was never considered hence it was denied a right to be heard.  In resisting this ground of appeal, the respondent took the position taken by the registrar in its decision that the process of restoration is wholly different and divorced from that of application for registration.",
            "24. That position is difficult to understand coming from the registrar whose mandate is to apply the provisions of the trade marks Act.  Under Section 44 of the Act make it mandatory that the registrar does not exercise his discretion in an adverse manner to the applicant or registered owner without according them the right to be heard.  It matters not that the decision he is to take does not amount to proceedings.  It is enough that the decision to be reached has the prospects of adversely affecting a party.  In the this case the Appellant had a pending applicants for registration over the same mark when the restoration process was initiated and concluded.  He was a person who was exposed to be affected and was indeed affected in that the decision to restore the trade mark effectively thwarted his application and rendered it a still birth.",
            "25. It is not difficult to see that there was a clear and claring denial of the right to be heard.  That was a fundamental breach to the law under the Act and surely cannot be left to stand.  More importantly is the fact that the registrar whom exercising his jurisdiction or discretion in terms of Section 44, is a tribunal inferior to the High Court and is bound by the directions or orders of the court.  That is why his decisions are amenable to judicial review and even appeals. ",
            "26.  After the proceedings were stayed pursuant to the Orders given in JR No. 19 of 2011, the final determination paved the way for the registrar to proceed with his mandate.  That same decision paving way for the conclusion of the opposition to registration did address this ground of appeal when the judge said the Appellant was entitled to be heard.  It was thus not expected for the Registrar to ignore a pronouncement by the Judge.  The judge in JR 19 of 2011 was explicit when he said at page 17 that:-       ",
            "“This Court is unable to accept the argument by the Respondent that Doshi had no right to participate or be informed of THKL’S request for restoration.  It would only seem fair for Doshi to be at least informed of the request for restoration because a decision to accept it would certainly have an implication on its pending application.  But what is to be done in these circumstances?”.",
            "27.  It is to be noted that the respondent was the respondent in the matter and participated fully hence cannot be taken not to have been aware of the determination over the question of the right to be heard.  I therefore do find the holding that the Appellant had no right to be heard at the restoration proceedings to have been a violation of the principles of natural justice and contrary to a court order for which reason the decision cannot stand and is hereby set aside.",
            "Did the assistant Registrar revisit a decision earlier made by the Registrar and thus purported to sit on appeal over the same",
            "28. According to the Appellant, the decision of the Assistant registrar appealed from amounted to sitting on appeal and upsetting the decision of the Registrar contained in the letter of 28/08/2009 by which the restoration of the trademark was refused.",
            "28.  The respondent’s position however is that the registrar was not functus officio after refusing registration because rules 67 and 68 allows him the power to restore a removed trademark into the register.  It was then contended that decision had not been validly challenged as held by the High Court in JR No. 19 of 2011 had upheld it and that in any event the notices giving rise to the removal were sent to a wrong address and were therefore invalid null and void ab initio.",
            "29. Even with such submissions both counsel did so little to address the point whether a determination by a registrar is immune to revisit even under Rules 68 and 70 of the Trade Mark Rules.  My view of this ground of appeal is that the law provides at Section 3(5) and 44 that any act or thing directed to be done by the Registrar can be done by an Assistant Registrar and that there is a wide latitude, the statement calls discretion, to do anything provided by the Act or Rules.  I do find that there is a power vested upon the registrar under Rule 68 and 70 to restore a removed trade mark after removal provided that he deems it just to do so and purposed to further that the restoration is advertised in the journal or Kenya gazette. ",
            "30. I do find that the power to remove has been mitigated with the power to restore provided the discretion is exercised upon reasons and in accordance with the notions of fairness and justice including observance of the Rules of Natural justice.  To the extent that the registrar exercised powers confered by Sections 3(5) 44 and Rules 68 and 70 of the Act, I note that he dealt with a matter which had been dealt with before by the registrar the question however is whether Rules 68 of the Rules anticipate a review or revisit of a decision by the registrar.  In my view, the  Rule permit consideration of an application to restore but does not include the right of power to review or reconsider a matter once considered and dealt with.  I therefore find that once a registrar makes a decision he becomes functus officio and the matter leaves his docket and remains for the court to review under Section 51 or on appeal under Section 52 of the Act.",
            "31. To this court the doctrine of functus officio serve the purpose of making a decision by a court or tribunal final.  It is intended to serve the need that dispute resolution or litigation is brought a close.  The power to review own decision must be donated by the law granting jurisdiction for it to be exercised and does not exist all the time and in every situation.  My reading of the Act creating the office and donating powers to the registrar does not give it the power to review or revisit own orders outside Rule 68 which I hold provides that the last act is to consider restoration without the power to revisit an order declining restoration. ",
            "31. The doctrine of functus officio generally dictate that a person or body vested with adjudicature or decision making powers, may exercise those powers only once in relation to the same matter.  A decision once given should be final and conclusive.  The doctrine however does not prevent the court from correcting clerical errors but a decision on the merits can only be challenged by way of an appeal[1].",
            "32. While a civil court is entitled to take other proceedings like execution and post judgment applications, such is grounded on express powers of the law say review under Section 80 and correction of errors under Section 99.  Strictly speaking however a court once it delivers itself on the merits is not expected to reopen the same matter and start all over again.",
            "33. In Telcom Kenya Ltd vs John Ochanda, the Court of Appeal rendered itself in the following words:-",
            "“The doctrine is not to be understood to bar any engagement by a court with a case that it has already decided or pronounce itself on.  What it does bar is merit based decisional re-engagement with the case once a final judgment has been entered and a decree thereon issued”.",
            "34. Put in the context of this matter the Registrar, Prof. James Otieno- Odek, did consider an application for restoration of TMA 17003 and made a merit based decision by a letter of 28/8/2009.  Once that was done and before it was set aside by way of review or appeal, by the court, it could never be reviewed by the same registration or his assistant.",
            "35. I think the powers of the register, exercisable by both him and his assistant(s), presents the best rationale for the application of the doctrine of functus officio.  When you have a registrar and several assistants, and a practice for free for all in intervention in decisions is adopted, one may imagine the kind of confusion that would ensue.  Such a practice would invite perception of impropriety that would not serve to imbue confidence in the office of the Registrar of Trade marks.  The adjudication power of the office need to be protected by it being laid that there is no jurisdiction for a registrar to revisit a merit based decision on restoration.",
            "36. The foregoing lead me to find that there was no jurisdiction upon the Assistant Registrar to proceed with the matter in a way she did.  Where there is no jurisdiction, it matters not that nobody challenges the act.  It shall not be sanitized by acquiescence or just being kept secret.  If it was done contrary to the law then it is invalid, null and void and of no consequence.  The Court of Appeal musk Deer Ltd vs Benjamin Kipkulei & 2 Others [2018] eKLR when faced with a comparable scenario had these words to pronounce itself:-",
            " “A court’s jurisdiction flows from either the Constitution or legislation or both.  Thus, a Court of law can only exercise jurisdiction as conferred by the Constitution or other written law.  It cannot arrogate to itself jurisdiction exceeding that which is conferred upon it by law.  We agree with counsel for the first and second respondent in his submission that the issue as to whether a Court of law has jurisdiction to entertain a matter before it, is not one of mere procedural technicality; it goes to the very heart of the matter, for without jurisdiction, the Court cannot entertain any proceedings … where the Constitution exhaustively provides for the jurisdiction of a Court of law, the Court must operate within the constitutional limits.  It cannot expand its jurisdiction through judicial craft or innovation”.",
            "37. I have found and held that there was no jurisdiction upon the Assistant Registrar to set to reopen and hear an application that had been heard and determined by the registrar on the basis that the statute vesting jurisdiction did not permit review of own orders.  Following that decision it follows that what is undertaken without jurisdiction adds to nothing.  A creature of the law cannot act contrary or outside the law.  In Samuel K. Macharia vs Kenya Commercial Bank the Superior Court reminded courts and I think, tribunals, that they have the unwavering and uncompressing duty to only exercise jurisdiction granted by law.  The court said:-",
            "“A court’s jurisdiction flows from either the Constitution or legislation or both.  Thus, a Court of law can only exercise jurisdiction as conferred by the Constitution or other written law.  It cannot arrogate to itself jurisdiction exceeding that which is conferred upon it by law.  We agree with counsel for the first and second respondent in his submission that the issue as to whether a Court of law has jurisdiction to entertain a matter before it, is not one of mere procedural technicality; it goes to the very heart of the matter, for without jurisdiction, the Court cannot entertain any proceedings … where the Constitution exhaustively provides for the jurisdiction of a Court of law, the Court must operate within the constitutional limits.  It cannot expand its jurisdiction through judicial craft or innovation.”",
            "38. On account of jurisdiction it matters not that the order of restoration was not challenged in time or all.  It was void, and one was entitled to deem it so even though it would be neater to have it set aside.  I do find and hold that the restoration proceedings conducted by the Assistant Registrar were null and void and of no effect.",
            "39. This finding now makes my further consideration of the remaining ground more of academic or just superfluous.  I do so hold because all proceedings and right held pursuant to the second restoration proceedings were based on a null and void order and were themselves null and void.  Accordingly nothing erected on nothing stands and cannot be the basis of assertion of any right.  This is the position I see the Court of Appeal to have taken in musk deer’s case supra, when it said:-",
            "[23] On our part we are satisfied in the circumstances of this matter any order(s) that was the outcome of those ex- parte proceedings was a nullity and void.See the persuasive authority in the case of; - Macfoy vs. United Africa Company Ltd. [1961] 3 ALL E.R 1169 wherein Lord Denning stated,",
            "“If an act is void, then it is in law a nullity. It is not only bad, but it is incurably bad. There is no need for an order of the court to be set aside. It is automatically null and void without more ado, though it is sometimes convenient to have the court declare it to be so. And every proceeding founded on it is also bad and incurably bad. You cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stay there. It will collapse.” ",
            "40. The upshot is that this appeal succeeds in entirety and in terms of Section 52 of the Trademarks Act as read with Section 78 of the Civil Procedure Act, I do aside the decision of the Assistant Registrar dated 24/10/2017 together with the decision of dated 11/01/2011 restoring the trade mark no. 17003 (THERMOS).",
            "41. That now leaves the registrar to consider the Appellant’s application for registration on its merits and in accordance with the law, I direct that the application be considered by any other registrar other than Elvin Opiyo. ",
            "42. The costs of the appeal is awarded to the Appellant as the successful party.",

        "judgement": [
            "1.The appeal is against the ruling of Olola, J. delivered on the 27th May, 2020, declining to set aside an ex parte judgment entered in the case.There were two applications before the Court which were heard together and the impugned ruling rendered in answer to both. One of the applications is dated 12th February 2019 brought by the appellant, which is the defendant in the consolidated suits. In the application, the appellant sought a temporary order of stay of execution of the judgment delivered on 11th October, 2018 as well as setting aside of the ex parte judgment and the re-opening of the defence case for hearing.",
            "2.There are 3 grounds listed in the memorandum of appeal. The appellant faults the Environment and Land Court (ELC) for dismissing its notice of motion application, accusing it of misdirecting itself in the exercise of discretion and for failing to consider the appellant’s defence as filed. The appellant seeks to have the ruling dated 27th May, 2020 set aside, and the application dated 12th February 2019 heard afresh by a different judge; that in the alternative this court pronounces itself on the said application based on the submissions filed by the parties in the ELC.",
            "3.This application was supported by an affidavit sworn by the appellant’s Operations Manager one Javed Mohamed Sidik. In short, the deponent premised the application on grounds the appellant’s defence was closed before it could prosecute it because the wife of the appellant’s witness was ill and required his personal attention; that the defence raised triable issues; that there were pending applications in the case dated 31st December 2012; that there was a judgment in HCCC No. 185 of 1991which declared the suit property a Wakf of the Mazrui, and their successors and was not available for adjudication.",
            "4.The respondents opposed the application and urged that the appellant had not explained delays in prosecuting the application of 31st December, 2012, and in bringing its application to set aside judgment; that it did not give a satisfactory reason why its witness failed to attend court on 4th December, 2018; and that the alleged judgment in HCCC No. 185 of 1991 did not conflict with the judgment of the ELC.",
            "5.The second application is dated 25th February 2019 filed by an entity referring itself as Trustees of the Mazrui Community [Welfare and Development) Wakf Lands Trust [the Proposed Interested Parties]. It was seeking to be enjoined to the suit as interested parties or defendants; and further that the judgment delivered on the 11th October 2018 be set aside.",
            "6.The second application was supported by an affidavit sworn by Trustees Chairman, one Salim Al-Amin Suleiman Mazrui. In his affidavit he averred that the applicants were vested with the management of the property in Takaungu, Kilifi County, known as LR 4226; that there was a judgment issued in HCCC No. 134 of 1991 which declared the adjudication exercise carried out by the Government after divesting the applicants of the suit property was illegal null and void; that the suit properties was private property belonging exclusively to the Mazrui; and, that the impugned judgment had the effect of dispossessing them of their land.",
            "7.The respondents opposed the application, and in the main they urged that the applicants were total strangers to the suit, and that including them would only serve to convolute the case.",
            "8.The suit before the ELC had been instituted by the respondents, who claimed to have all been residing for many years in their respective portions of land situated at Vuma-Maweni/Takaungu village (hereinafter the suit properties) within Kilifi District; that their rights and interests were adjudicated upon and were ascertained in accordance with the law. That they were aggrieved by the appellant’s actions of fencing off and cutting the respondents’ trees on the suit land and denying them use of the land. They sued the appellant which, in its defence averred that a number of the respondents sold the suit land to it on willing buyer- willing seller basis.",
            "9.The ELC, after considering the reason given by the appellant why its witness was not able to attend court on 4th December 2017; after considering the numerous number of times the case was adjourned on account of the appellant; considering the delay of bringing the application under consideration of almost a year, concluded that the application was not merited for lack of supporting document to prove that the wife of the appellant’s witness was indeed ill as to prevent him attend court; that the reason for the delay in bringing the instant application until judgment was entered was unreasonable, and that in all the appellant had failed to demonstrate excusable mistake, accident or inadvertence to warrant the court exercise its discretion in his favour.",
            "10.In regard to the application by the Proposed Interested Parties it was dismissed and is not appealed. We leave it at that.",
            "11.The appellant was represented by Kanyi J & Co Advocates, who filed submissions dated 2nd October 2021. Ms. Mango learned counsel argued this appeal before us virtually on 16th March 2022. Counsel relied on the case of Pithon Waweru Maina v Thuka Mugiria (1983) eKLR and urged that the court ought to have considered that the appellant’s defence raised triable issues. The court was faulted for failing to find that the respondents would suffer no prejudice if the defence case was reopened; that the reason given by the appellant for non-attendance was excusable. It was further pointed out that the judgment of the court was in conflict with the decision in HCCC 185 of 1991 where it was found that the repeal of the Mazrui Land Trust Act was null and void therefore all the affected parcels of land including that of the appellant, vested in the Mazrui as the lawful proprietors.",
            "12.Submissions in opposition to the appeal were filed by J.K. Mwarandu & Co Advocates and were dated 9th November, 2021. Mr. Shujaa learned counsel from the same firm represented the respondents in this appeal. Counsel, relied on the case of Philes Nyokabi Kamau v ICDC, Civil Appeal 263 of 2014 for the proposition that a judge’s discretion ought not to be interfered with unless there was misdirection of law, a misapprehension of facts, consideration of irrelevant factors or failure to consider relevant matters resulting in a wrong decision and injustice. Counsel posited that the court did not err but was not satisfied with the reason given by the appellant’s witness for failing to attend court on the day of the hearing. It was also pointed out that the court noted the appellant was guilty of laches and hence undeserving of discretion; that the appellant’s case was closed in December 2017 and the application was presented in February 2019; that the delay was unexplained. It was refuted that the judgment in HCCC 185 of 1991 conflicts with the judgment rendered by the court.",
            "13.This is a first appeal. The appellant is challenging the exercise of discretion by the ELC, and has urged us to set aside the decision appealed for being erroneous. In order for us to interfere with the exercise of discretion by the Judge, certain parameters must be met. This Court in Mulemi v Angweye & another (Civil Appeal 170 of 2016) [2021] KECA 214 (KLR) (Civ) (5 November 2021) (Judgment) while discussing the principles to be had in regard to a challenge against exercise of discretion of a Superior Court observed as follows;“In Mbogo & Another vs. Shah [1968] E.A 93; at page 94, paragraph H - 1 Sir Clement De Lestang V.-P: had this to say:I think it is well settled that this Court will not interfere with the exercise of discretion by an inferior court unless it is satisfied that its decision is clearly wrong, because it has misdirected itself or because it has acted on matters on which it should not have acted or because it has failed to take into consideration matters which it should have taken into consideration and in doing so arrived at a wrong conclusion.”",
            "14.The power to set aside an ex parte judgment, is unfettered. It is trite that there are no limits or restrictions on the judge’s discretion except that if he does vary the judgment he does on such terms as he thinks fit. [See Patel v EA Cargo Handling Services Ltd [1974] EA 75 at 76]. It is intended to be exercised in order to avoid hardship resulting from accident, inadvertence, or excusable mistake or error, but is not designed to assist the person who has deliberately sought, whether by evasion or otherwise, to obstruct or delay the course of justice. [See Shah v Mbogo [1967] EA 116 at 123B:]. The question the ELC should have asked itself when considering the application is whether the applicant had a reasonable excuse or explanation that prevented its witness from attending court; or whether it has established that there was a mistake or inadvertence that may have led to the non-attendance in court.",
            "15.The learned Judge of the ELC considered the supporting affidavit of the appellant’s witness sworn in support of the application and observed:“9.In support of that application the Defendant relies on a Supporting Affidavit sworn by its Operations Manager JavedMohamed Sidik who avers that on 4th December 2018 when the matter came up for defence hearing, he was unavailable as his wife had been taken ill….12.The Defendant’s Operations Manager avers that he was aware of the hearing date of 4th December 2017. He however asserts that he was prevented from attending the hearing as his wife had been ailing for some time and her condition had suddenly worsened on the date when the matter was to be heard.13.That averment is unfortunately not supported by any evidence. The Defendant has not attached any medical evidence or other evidence to support the position… that the wife… had been ailing.”",
            "16.The ELC proceeded to consider the number of times the defence case had not taken place and the reasons given for it, and based on that consideration concluded that the record did not make the excuse given for non- attendance in December 2017 believable, as it demonstrated deliberate attempts to delay and obstruct the matter. On these grounds the application was declined.",
            "17.With respect to the ELC judge, whereas documentary or medical proof that the wife of its witness was ailing would have strengthened the case for allowing the application, we have considered the supporting affidavit of Mr. Sidik and the record of the proceedings. The number of adjournments by the appellant were not all attributable to this witness, The initial witness the appellant intended to call was one, Mr. Ashok. On eight (8) occasions prior to the time under consideration [December 2017] the witness was reported to be ill, at other occasions he was reported to have traveled out of the country. The final report on him was that he died,",
            "18.The other observation we make of the learned Judge’s exercise of discretion is the disregard for very serious issues which were equally important, deserving of consideration, and which would have put the matter under consideration in a clear perspective. The matter of the existence of a Judgment that touched on the suit property, which could conflict with the decision of the ELC was raised. That judgment was annexed to Mr. Sidik’s affidavit. It’s a judgment of the High Court and was delivered in 2012. It shows that it touches on ownership of 9100 acres of land in the same area as the land in dispute in the instant matter. That was an important matter, and it could not be determined in submissions, as the respondents’ counsel purported to do. Had the ELC considered that matter, we think it could have come to a different conclusion of the matter.",
            "19.Having considered this appeal, we are satisfied that the decision of the learned ELC judge was clearly wrong, on account of misdirections; on account of failing to take into consideration matters which it should have taken into consideration. Due to these flaws, we find that the Judge arrived at a wrong conclusion, thus giving us the right to intervene in the matter.",
            "20.In the result we allow the appeal and make the following orders:1)The ruling of the J.O. Olola, J, delivered at Malindi on the 27th May, 2020 be and is hereby set aside in its entirety.2)The application dated 12th February 2019 by the appellant be and is hereby allowed to the extent that the appellant’s defence case is re-opened for hearing.3)The matter be placed for hearing before any judge in the ELC other than Olola, J.4)Due to the nature of this application and of the case, each party will bear their own costs of the appeal."

        "judgement": [
            "1.The application before this Court for ruling is a Notice of Motion dated 27th October 2020, which seeks orders that pending hearing and determination of the intended appeal against the decision of the High Court (P.J. Otieno J.) delivered in Mombasa High Court Civil Appeal No 108 of 2013, there be a stay of execution of the decree in Mombasa CMCC 2957 of 2006. The application is supported by an affidavit of even date sworn by Gulamhussein Fakrudin Gulamhussein, the Applicant’s Director, and is based on the fact that the Respondent has obtained a certificate of costs in Mombasa CMCC 2957 of 2006 which he intends to execute, pursuant to the impugned judgment of the High Court which granted the Respondent costs of the suit in Mombasa CMCC 2957 of 2006 and of the appeal therefrom in Mombasa High Court Civil Appeal No 108 of 2013. Further, that the Respondent has also indicated his intention to tax the Bill of Costs in Mombasa High Court Civil Appeal No. 108 of 2013.",
            "2.In response, the Respondent apposed the instant application by way of a replying affidavit he swore on 25th February 2021. The Respondent’s case is that under Rule 75 of the Court of Appeal Rules of 2010, the instant application herein should be premised on a valid Notice of Appeal, and that the filing of an application by the Applicant for extension of time to file a Notice of Appeal repudiates the existence of a valid notice of appeal. The Respondent explained that after the Applicant filed its Record of Appeal in the substantive appeal being in Mombasa Civil Appeal No 116 of 2019 on 26th August 2019, he subsequently filed an application dated 30th September 2019 to strike out the Record of Appeal, whereupon the Applicant filed the application for extension of time to file a fresh Notice of Appeal on 27th November 2019, and that the said applications are pending hearing. The Respondent annexed copies of the said applications.",
            "3.A brief background to the application is that the Applicant had filed a suit in the subordinate Court in Mombasa RMCC 2957 of 2006 against the Respondent, for the sum of Kshs. 281,604/= and interest thereon, and judgment was awarded in his favour. On appeal, the High Court, by the impugned judgment delivered in Mombasa High Court Civil Appeal No. 108 of 2013 set aside the subordinate Court’s judgment on account of the Applicant’s suit being time-barred, and awarded the Respondent the costs of the suit in the subordinate court and of the appeal, which is the decision being challenged in the appeal filed in this Court.",
            "4.Learned counsel Mr. Atancha appeared for the Applicant during the hearing of the instant application on 14th March 2022, and relied on his respective written submissions, while noting that he filed a Notice of Appeal which was in his Record of Appeal of the substantive appeal. There was no attendance on behalf of the Respondent, although we note that his advocates filed written submissions dated 25th February 2021, which we have relied on. The main issue for determination in this application is whether the Applicant has met the threshold for grant of the prayers sought.",
            "5.The Respondent has in this respect challenged the jurisdiction of this Court’ to grant the orders sought by the Applicant, on the ground that there is no valid Notice of Appeal, since the Applicant moved this Court to withdraw the said Notice of Appeal. It is indeed the position that this court is properly seized of an application for stay of execution under Rule 5(2) (b) where a notice of appeal has been lodged in accordance with Rule 75 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The said rule requires the said Notice of Appeal to be lodged within 14 days of the judgment intended to be appealed against. This position was also confirmed by this Court in Halai & Another v Thornton & Turpin [1963] Ltd. [1990] KLR 365.",
            "6.There was no Notice of Appeal annexed to the affidavit in support of the instant application, nor in the Record of Appeal in Mombasa Civil Appeal 116 of 2019, which the Applicant’s counsel referred us to. However, the Applicant did annex a copy of a Notice of Appeal lodged on 17th May 2017 against the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court on 3rd May 2017, in its application dated 27th November 2019 filed in Mombasa Civil Application 110 of 2019, in which it sought to have the said Notice of Appeal withdrawn and leave to file a fresh Notice of Appeal. We also note that a ruling dated 9th July 2021 was delivered by M. Warsame J.A., dismissing the said application. We therefore find that since the Notice of Appeal dated 17th May 2020 was lodged within time, is still on record, and no evidence has been brought that it has not been struck out, we are properly seized of the instant application.",
            "7.We will therefore proceed with an examination of whether the Applicant has satisfied the twin limbs restated and amplified by this Court in Stanley Kangethe Kinyanjui vs Tony Ketter & 5 Others [2013] eKLR, namely that it has an arguable appeal, and that unless an order of stay is granted the appeal or intended appeal would be rendered nugatory. On the first limb, the Applicant’s counsel urged that the Applicant has an arguable appeal, as the High Court erred in addressing the issue of limitation of time, which had not been raised on appeal, and that his appeal is therefore not idle or frivolous. The Respondent’s counsel on his part submitted that costs are the only element of the impugned judgment capable of being executed, and the instant application is therefore an aberration. We are however cognisant of the fact that in the first limb of an arguable appeal, the Applicant need only demonstrate one arguable ground, and further that an arguable appeal is not necessarily one that will succeed. The Applicant has raised concerns on whether its suit in the subordinate court was time barred, which in our view is an issue of law that merits consideration by this Court. To this extent we find that the Applicant’s intended appeal is arguable.",
            "8.On the second limb, the Applicant’s counsel submitted that the subject matter of the appeal, which according to him is the costs, should be preserved, and urged this Court to find that the Respondent will be unable to refund the costs in the event the Applicant’s appeal is successful. The Respondent’s counsel submitted that it has not been shown how the intended appeal will be rendered nugatory should the stay be refused, and no offer of security has been put forth by the Applicant.",
            "9.In this regard, we note that the instant application is firstly seeking a stay of execution of “the decree in Mombasa CMCC 2957 of 2006”. This prayer for stay is misplaced and cannot be granted, as the said decree was set aside by the impugned judgment of the High Court on appeal, which judgment has not been overturned. The said decree is in effect non-existent, and there is nothing to be stayed to this extent. In his submissions, the Applicant’s counsel submitted that he is seeking to stay the certificate of costs issued in in Mombasa CMCC 2957 of 2006, so as to preserve the appeal from the High Court’s judgment. It is also notable in this regard that the impugned judgment by the High Court was a negative order which is incapable of stay, as held by this Court in National Cereals and Produce Board v Errad Supplies & General Contractors Limited, Nairobi Civil Application No. Nai 48 of 2012 and Nguruman Limited v Shompole Group Ranch & Another, Civil Application No. Nai 90 of 2013, [2014] eKLR.",
            "10.Lastly, it was held in Stanley Kangethe Kinyanjui vs Tony Ketter & 5 others [2013] that whether or not an appeal will be rendered nugatory depends on whether or not what is sought to be stayed or injuncted, if allowed to happen is reversible; or if it is not reversible whether damages will reasonably compensate the party aggrieved. It is not evident how the Applicant’s appeal will be rendered nugatory as the judgment of the High Court appealed against was a negative order, and as costs are a money judgment, it is our view that the Applicant can also be adequately compensated by damages if his appeal is found to be successful. We therefore find that the Applicant has not met the threshold for the second limb for these reasons.",
            "11.We accordingly find that the Applicant’s Notice of Motion dated 27th October 2020 is not merited, and the said application is accordingly dismissed with costs to the Respondents.",
            "12.Orders accordingly."

            "\t2. The memorandum of Appeal dated 19/8/2013 attacks the judgment of the trial court on the following grounds:-",
            "i. THAT the learned trial magistrate erred in law in entering judgment for the respondent in respect of a claim that was manifestly time-barred.",
            "ii. THAT the learned magistrate erred in refusing to set aside the leave to file suit out of time granted at inception of suit.",

THAT the learned magistrate erred in construing the period when time began to run for purposes of the respondent’s claim and/or in failing to appreciate that the respondent’s assertion that time began to run once formal demand was made was inconsistent with the seeking of leave to extend time.",

            "\t6. The amendment to the plaint was effected pursuant to the Order by the court granted on 16.4.2010 by T. Gesora (SRM).  That ruling allowing leave to amend shows that the defense and plea of statute bar was raised because the record reveal the court to have said:-",
            "“Though it is true that the extension of time can be challenged, I am satisfied that all factors were considered when the order was given and that the claim is properly before court.  Ammendment can be allowed even though the effect would be to introduce a completely new cause of action or new parties”.",
            "\t7. That reasoning and decision seems to have held sway all along because even in the judgment the trial court said;",
            "“On the issue of invocation of limitation of actions Act,  Cap 22, in regard to the claim being statute barred, I find that the same was settled by my predecessor who  intervened and decided on the same”.",
            "\t8. I have reproduced those portions of the two decisions in the Record of appeal just to underscore how deeply the question of limitation was embedded in the litigation between the parties.  It was therefore a core and critical question that the court was properly seized of and ought to have been given due attention and consideration by the court in the judgment appealed against.",
            "The evidence adduced",
            "\t9. At trial the plaintiff called one witness John Kiio who introduced himself as an employee of the defendant.  He produced the receipts he said the defendant signed and relied on the conditions of sale at the back of the receipts to have entitled the plaintiff to claim interest at 5% on the overdue sums.  Those receipts were for the period pleaded being between 22.5.1998 and 11.6.1998 and produced as PEXH 1.",
            "\t10. He also produced a final demand letter dated 17/6/2004 as exhibit P2.  On cross examination the witness told the court that there was no formal contract between the parties that the suit was filed in court on 4/9/2006 and that the first demand was made in the year 2000.  The plaintiff’s case was then closed and the defendant opted not to call any witness.",
            "\t11. When the parties were granted an opportunity to file written submissions, the plaintiff filed very brief submissions emphasing the fact that the defendant did not call any evidence and that the documents produced proved that the sum sued for was owed and that the sum according to the documents attracted interests at 5%.  Those submission totally steered clear of the issue of limitation.",
            "\t12. On behalf of the defendant very elaborate submissions were tendered outlining the pleadings filed and the evidence adduced thereof and decided cases were then cited to support the line of defense that the suit was statutorily time barred.  On that defence argument were advanced on two points:-",
            "i) There is no jurisdiction in the court to extend time for a cause of action grounded on contract.",
            "ii) The leave once granted could only be challenged at trial.",
            "\t13. The defendant then relied on the decided case of Divecon Ltd vs  Sinani [1995-1988] 1 E.A 48 where the Court of Appeal held that the words in section 4(1) left no doubt that no one had the right or power to bring an action founded in contract after the expiry of six years from the date the cause of action accrued.",
            "\t14. For the proposition that leave once granted is due for challenge at trial the counsel cited the decision in Aruta & Anor vs Nyanabo [1988] KLR 590 with addition that such would apply where there was a discretion to be exercised like in instances of tort but where there is no jurisdiction the court had the right under its inherent powers to set aside an order given without jurisdiction as of right.  The Court of Appeal in Ngerenyo vs Keri, Civil Appeal No. 9/97(UR) which followed the English decision in Craig vs Kanseen [1943] 1KB 256 was cited for the latter proposition.",
            "\t15. Lastly the defendant argued that the amended plaint was never supported by evidence as far as the date the final demand was allegedly made and maintained that the terms of sale at the back of the receipts indicated that the terms were strictly monthly and accounts were due for payment by the 15th of the following month.  For those submissions the defendant urged the trial court to dismiss the suit for having been filed out of time and was that statutorily time barred.",
            "Analysis and determination",
            "\t16. I have commented hereinabove and now repeat that the trial court did give to the question of limitation what I consider to be casual and cursory attention and consideration yet it was a critical and all important matter the court was duty bound to consider before it could go to the merits.  I say so because the question of limitation as pleaded in the amended defence went to jurisdiction and if the court was to find that the matter was statutorily time barred then, it had no otherwise but to down its tools.",
            "\t17. In the decision by the Supreme Court of India in Rana Vijey Kumar Oberoi thro’ GPH vs Sunita Sudam Ranaware, Civil Appeal No. 7732 of 2011 the court said cited with approval the decision in Pandurang Dhoni Chougule vs Maruti Hari Jadhar to the effect that:-",
            "“It is well settled that a plea of limitation or plea of res judicata is a plea of law which concerns the jurisdiction of the court which tries the proceedings.  A finding on those pleas in favour of the party raising them would oust jurisdiction of the court…..”",
            "\t18. Although decided by a court outside our jurisdiction, that decision is in full consonance with the jurisprudence in this country on jurisdiction and the most commonly cited is the case of Owners of Motor Vessel Lelian ‘S’ vs Total (Kenya) Ltd where the court of appeal stressed the point that where jurisdiction is raised, the court must summount it first before making any further endeavor since jurisdiction is everything.",
            "\t19. In the Appeal before me the trial court did not only gloss over the matter but equally abdicated its duty in law to consider that forcefully taken matter.  That court was duty bound to consider whether or not the leave was validly given.  Instead of giving the question the due and merited thought,  it took the view and held that his predecessor had dealt with the matter finally in the application to amend the plaint.  To that extend the trial court was openly and clearly in error which error ought and must be corrected by this court as a first appellate court relooking the question.",
            "\t20. I have had a chance to read the limitation of action Act and in particular section 22 and 28 thereof and I am fully persuaded that there is no jurisdiction, in anybody including the court as correctly stated by the Court of Appeal Divecon Ltd vs Simani (supra).  This was the funding the trial court was called upon to make but it failed in its duty.",
            "\t21. That notwithstanding however what do the facts as pleaded in the plaint reveal.  It is clear that the only evidence of the dealing between the parties are the receipts produced as exhibits PEXH 1.",
            "\t22. Those documents particularly the invoice, which I consider to be a demand, and dated the 26/5/1998 has two sets of terms of the contract.  On the face of it at the foot, the document gave the term in bold that TERMS STRICLTY MONTHLY.  At the reverse of the same document there are four terms and conditions.  The relevant one on when the cause of action cross are to this court conditions 3 & 4.  The same are worded as follows:-",
            "“3      All accounts are due on demand.",
            "4      Accounts must be paid by the 15th of the following month.”.",
            "\t23. In law and under the sale of goods Act, Section 29, the right of a seller to be paid the purchase price is concurrent with delivery unless the contrary intention is shown.  The Act also defines the term monthly to mean a calendar months.",
            "\t24. For the transaction between the parties, I am in no doubt that it was agreed that the payment would be monthly and not later than the 15th day of the following month.  I understand and interpret those terms to mean that all supplies for the month of May for example would be due for payment by the month of June.  I do not consider if a correct interpretation that the defendant in those circumstances and on the terms of sale was excused from making payment merely because a written demand, by way of a letter had not been made.",
            "\t25.  Conversely, the plaintiffs cause of action was not held at ramson merely because no demand letter had been served. NO. The obligation to pay was covenanted to be monthly and therefore the last sale having been on the 11.6.1998 the last date the defendant was obligated to pay was the at the latest, regard being had to condition 4 at the reverse of the cash sale receipts, the 15th of July 1998.  That is when the breach, failure to pay occurred.",
            "\t26. That to me was the day the cause of action accrued when there was no payment.  If the plaintiff decided to make a demand, such was made gratis and out of abundant of caution but such was not the determining factor or date for the cause of action to accrue.",
            "\t27. It therefore follows that the plaintiff cause of action accrued in the month of July 1998 and therefore in terms of section 4(1) Limitation of Actions Act, the suit for recovery was due for initiation not later than the 31/7/2004.  It further follows that on the 4/9/2006 when the suit was filed the same was already statutorily time barred and being a cause in contract there was no recourse at reviving it by an application to extend time.  It remained a dead cause of action into which no life could be breathed in the manner and fashion the plaintiff sought to do.",
            "\t28. In any event and in common commercial balance an invoice is a formal demand for payment with terms of payment.  Once issued there would be the need for a demand letter unless contested.",
            "\t29. I therefore find and hold that to the extent that the suit was filed  outside time, it was an act in futility and all the order issued pursuant thereto were issued without  jurisdiction and were a nullity ab initio.  As the trial court had no jurisdiction to extend time, it did not matter that leave was granted nor did it matter that the plaint was amended by an order of the court.  The court before whom the suit was filed was divested of jurisdiction to entertain it as it did.",
            "\t30. The upshot is that the appeal is wholly merited, it is allowed and the judgment and decision of the trial court, Hon Ekhubi (SRM) dated 31/7/2013 was erroneously made and is therefore set aside and in its place substituted an order dismissing the suit with costs.",
            "\t31. I award to the Appellant the costs of both this appeal and the costs before the trial court.",

Upon his appointment, the petitioner was to hold office for a non-renewable term of 6 years.\n\n\t\tUnder section 67 of the County Governments Act, No 17 of 2012, appointments to the county public service would not be valid unless they were evidenced in writing. The import of section 67 was that the appointment would be evidenced in writing and that an appointment could be contained in a letter of appointment or evidenced from a document or series of documents.\n\n\t\tThe petitioner's appointment was evidenced in writing by the document titled, \"Oath of office of the Chairman of the Embu County Service Board\" which was signed by the Governor, the County Secretary and the petitioner.\n\n\t\tIt was the Embu County Government's duty to issue the petitioner with a letter of appointment and it could not argue that the petitioner's appointment was incomplete for want of a letter of appointment or gazettement.\n\n\t\tA Gazette notice would not constitute the notice or the law itself but it would be the official announcement of the existence of the law or notice or the coming into effect of the law or notice. Therefore, the validity of a notice or law would not reside in the Gazette but in the persons or bodies tasked with the responsibility to make such laws or notices in accordance with the law.\n\n\t\tPertaining to the removal of the petitioner from office the requirements of section 58(5) of the County Governments Act, No 17 of 2012, were that such removal would be based on grounds set out for the removal of members of a constitutional commission under article 251(1) of the Constitution and be via a vote of not less than 75% of all members of the County Assembly.\n\n\t\tArticle 251(1)  of the Constitution of Kenya 2010, provided that a member of a commission, except an ex-officio member, or the holder of an independent office, could be removed from office only for-\n\n\n\n\t\tSerious violations of the Constitution or any other law;\n\n\t\tGross misconduct, in the performance of an office holder's functions or otherwise;\n\n\t\tPhysical or mental incapacity to perform the functions of the office\n\n\t\tIncompetence; or,\n\n\t\tBankruptcy.\n\n\n\n\t\tThere was a failure to demonstrate that the petitioner's removal from office was related to the grounds provided for in law and that there was a decision for removal passed by 75% of the members of the County Assembly. The removal via a letter rescinding the appointment was not in compliance with the prescribed procedure.\n\n\t\tIt would be appropriate to issue the order of certiorari to quash the decision to rescind the petitioner's appointment and to also grant an injunction to restrain the removal of the petitioner from office by the respondents.\n\n\nPetition allowed.\n",

            "\t\tIn support of the petition, the petitioner contended through his Counsel Mr. Kibe Mungai, that:",
            "\ta)  That in the Sunday Nation of 12th May, 2013 the First and Second Respondents re-advertised several posts seeking qualified persons to fill various positions in the Embu County Public Service Board. Pursuant to the said Re-Advertisement the Petitioner successfully applied for the position of Chairperson and he was duly appointed by the Second Respondent and thereafter     sworn as the Chairman of the Embu County Public Service Board on 11th July, 2013.",
            "\tb) Counsel argued that by dint of Section 58(4) (a) of the County Government Act, 2012, the petitioner upon being appointed and sworn as the Chairman of the Embu County Public Service Board he was entitled to hold office for a non renewable term of six years.",
            "\tc) Counsel further argued that by dint of Section 58(5) of the County Governments Act, 2012 members of the county Public Service Board may only be removed from office-",
            "\t     i)  on grounds set out for the removal of members of a constitutional commission under Article 251(1) of the constitution; and",
            "\t     ii)     by a vote of not less than seventy five per cent of all the members of County assembly.",
            "\td) According to him the grounds set out under Article 251(1) of the constitution for removal are as follows:-",
            "\t     i)  serious violation of this Constitution or any other law, including a contravention of chapter six;",
            "\t     ii)  gross misconduct, whether in the performance of the member's  or office holder's functions or otherwise;",
            "\t                 ii)  physical or mental incapacity to perform the functions  of office;",
            "\t     iii)  incompetence; or",
            "\t     iv)  bankruptcy.",
            "\te) Mr. Mungai submitted that the foregoing provisions notwithstanding, by a letter dated 30th August, 2013 the Second Respondent wrote to the Clerk of County Assembly of Embu requesting it to revoke its recommendation in respect of the appointment of the Petitioner as chairman, Embu County Public Service Board on the grounds that he had demanded higher salary, remunerations and         benefits outside statutory provisions by Salaries and Remuneration Commission Circular No. SRC/TS/CGOVT/3/61 and that he had verbally rejected the letter of appointment to office dated 19th July, 2013.",
            "\tf) According to Counsel for the Petitioner, the aforesaid request to the County Assembly was null and void ab initio since the the Petitioner having been nominated and appointed by the County Governor with the approval of the County Assembly  pursuant to Section 58(1)(a) of the County governments Act, 2012 there ceased to be any recommendation which the Assembly could be asked to revoke",
            "\tg) In the alternative he submitted that even assuming that such a recommendation existed, the County Assembly became functus officio after the same was acted upon by the Governor as signified by the appointment of the Petitioner and subsequent swearing in as the Chairman of the Embu County Public Service Board on 11th July, 2013.",
            "\th) According to Counsel therefore, the petitioner's removal could only be in accordance with section 58(5) of the County Governments Act.",
            "\ti) Regarding the motion passed by the Assembly to rescind the petitioner's appointment, Counsel submitted that such resolution was unlawful, invalid, null and void ab initio on the grounds that, since the Assembly was not the body that made the decision to appoint the petitioner, they could not validly in law make a decision to rescind the appointment. Further, the Assembly could only act to approve a motion seeking removal of the petitioner predicated on a finding by the first and second respondents as envisaged under Section 58(5)(a) of the County Governments Act, 2012.  In the instant case there was no such finding or decision by the first or second respondent seeking removal of the petitioner or any of the grounds set out under article 251(1) of the constitution.",
            "\tj) According to Mr. Mungai the grounds upon which the petitioner was purportedly removed do not constitute grounds for removal set out in section 58(5)(a) of the county Governments Act, 2012.",
            "\th) The Petitioner averred in his affidavit in support of the petition that the grounds upon which the County Assembly of Embu revoked his engagement or approval of the same were false, malicious and misleading information. He argued that given that he had not been given the alleged letter of appointment dated 19th July, 2013 whose existence has said he was unaware, he could not, reject the same verbally.",
            "\tk) The Petitioner contended that the process, grounds and mode of his removal as the Chairman of the Embu County Public Service Board constituted a gross violation to the 2nd and 3rd Respondents of the National Values and Principles of Governance set out in article 10 of the Constitution and further  that the Second Respondent's decision, actions and omissions offend the rule of law and violated his human dignity and rights as protected by articles 27, 28, 41, 47 and 50 of the constitution.",
            "\tl) According to him the purported removal had been actuated by apparent    malice and ill-will against him on the part of the second respondent which has been occasioned by the latter's aversion towards the   petitioner's unwillingness to overlook or skew the law and recruitment of staff process to rubber-stamp appointment of the 2nd respondent's preferred candidate for position of the County Secretary.",
            "\tm) The Petitioner argues that the actions by the 1st and 2nd respondents violated his human rights and fundamental freedoms in that under under article 27 of the Constitution, he has a right to equal protection and equal benefit of the law which enjoins  the first and second  respondents to remove him from the office through due process of law and simultaneously prohibited them from terminating his tenure unless the petitioner became or was found unqualified on the grounds set out in Article 251(1) of the Constitution.",
            "\tn) The petitioner complained that the first and second respondents' false allegations contained in the second respondent's letter dated 30th August, 2013 violated  and negated his human dignity as they cast him as a greedy and irresponsible person who has violated his oath of office and even declined his letter of appointment purportedly dated 19th July, 2013.",
            "\to) He further complains that the refusal, negligence and failure of the first and second respondents to prepare and execute a six-year contract with the petitioner and furnish him with a letter of appointment is not only discriminatory against him but also violates his right to fair labour practice secured and guaranteed under Article 41 of the Constitution.",
            "b) Respondent's response and submissions.",
            "\t\tIn opposition to the petition, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd respondents filed a replying affidavit through Margaret Lorna Kariuki which set  the respondents' position on the dispute as follows:",
            "\t\tTHAT Section 67 of the County Government Act No. 17 of 2012 stated in a mandatory term that, no appointment or assignment of a duty         in a County Service shall be valid unless it was evidenced in writing, and that the requirement was further buttressed in the Public Service Commission Regulations under Regulation 23 which stated that public appointments shall be in writing.  This regulation, she deponed was applicable to County Public Service.",
            "\t\tThat the petitioner having not satisfied these mandatory provisions of the law could not  claim violation of his rights as envisaged in article 251 of the Constitution. According to her, the petitioner was not duly appointed as a County servant.",
            "\t\tTHAT the applicant was merely recommended by the County Assembly for the position of Chairman of the 3rd respondent a process which had not completed before he declined the terms and conditions as provided     by the SRC.",
            "\t\tTHAT the terms and conditions and the rules of engagement in the County Public Service have always been very clear to all and sundry including the petitioner, right from the time of placing advertisement to the position yet he rejected them after recommendation for appointment.",
            "\t\t THAT the County Government was bound in law to implement the remuneration structure as dictated by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission without any alteration whatsoever. ",
            "\t\tTHAT the petitioner being dissatisfied with the proposed remuneration by the SRC, declined to take up the appointment letter and or sign the contract of service demanding a to start at the apex of the remuneration matrix against the directives as given by the commission.",
            "\t\t THAT thereafter the petitioner unilaterally, illegally and to the detriment of hampering the boards' functions absconded duty after being sworn in and never performed his role due to the impending standoff whereas the other board members had all accepted and signed their respective contracts of service.",
            "\t\tMr Njoroge who appeared for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd respondent submitted along the above lines emphasizing on the main that section 58(5) of the County Governments Act relied on by the petitioner only applied to duly appointed county servants. According to counsel, the petitioner was not a duly appointed county servant since the circle of appointment was not complete. It was his submission that the circle becomes complete when letter of appointment is issued and gazettement is done.",
            "\t\tCounsel submitted further that under section 58(5)(b) of the County Governments Act, by a vote of 75% of the County Assembly members, a removal can be done. So that if the petitioner was properly appointed, then he was properly removed. He submitted that subsection 5(a) was applicable to national and not county commissions.",
            "\t\tRegarding the issue of functus officio, Mr. Njoroge submitted that the County Assembly in its legislative duty plays watchdog to the County government and cannot be functus officio. In that capacity they work any time  .",
            "c) Issues for determination.",
            "\t\tI have endavoured to outline as extensively as possible the complaints by the petitioner and submissions by his counsel vis-a-vis rejoinder thereto by the counsel for the respondent and become of the view that the issues for determination in this petition can be collapsed into four as follows:",
            "\t\tWhether the petitioner's appointment as the Chair of the Embu County Assembly Service Board was complete upon his being sworn in, without his gazettment  and issuance with a letter of appointment.",
            "\t\tWhether the disputed removal of the petitioner as the chair of 3rd respondent violated the constitutional and statutory provisions and procedure. That is to say: did the disputed removal comply with the provisions of section 58(5) of the County Government Act in terms of grounds and procedure?",
            "\t\tAmong the fleet of remedies sought by the petitioner which is the most appropriate in the event that the court reaches the conclusion the petition is successful?",
            "\t\tWhat is the appropriate order as to costs?",
            "The decision.",
            "\t\t On the question whether the petitioner's appointment as the Chair of the Embu County Assembly Service Board was complete upon his being sworn in, without his gazettment  and issuance with a letter of appointment, the court would like to observe that there seems to be a contradictory scenario where the respondents' counsel contend that the appointment was incomplete yet on the other hand a removal process reserved for a duly appointed officer  was apparently used. That notwithstanding, in order to determine this first question, the court draws reference to section 58(2) read together with section 58(3) which provides that the appointment of members of the County Public Service Board shall be through a competitive process and a person shall be qualified for such appointment if that person satisfies the provisions of chapter six of the constitution; is not a state public officer; in the case of chairperson or vice-chairperson, possess a minimum qualification of a bachelor's degree from a recognized university and working experience of not less than five years, is professional, demonstrates absence of breach of the relevant professional code of conduct.",
            "\t\tThere was no dispute that the petitioner met the criteria set out above. The dispute was rather how his appointment could in law,  be validly signified.",
            "\t\t Section 67 of the County Governments Act provides that no appointment of a duty in a county public service shall be valid unless evidenced in writing. Further section 58(4)(a) of the Act provides that a member of the Board shall hold office for a non-  renewable term of six years. Stopping here for a moment, section 67 referred to above states that the appointment shall be evidenced in writing (italics supplied). Black's Law dictionary defines evidence as “...something that tends to prove or disprove the existence of an alleged fact. Whereas Mr. Kibe Mungai for the petitioner contended that the swearing in of the petitioner was sufficient proof of his appointment, Mr. Njoroge for the first three respondents submitted that the fact of non-signing of the letter of appointment by the petitioner and eventual non-gazettment by the 2nd respondent meant that the petitioner's appointment was incomplete.",
            "\t\t The document marked 'MNG2” attached to the petitioner's affidavit is titled “Oath of office of the chairman of the Embu County Public Service Board”. In it the petitioner is recorded to swear to serve the people of of the Republic of Kenya in the office of member of the County Public Service Board of Embu County and that he shall discharge his duties and perform his functions in the said office, to  the best of his judgment. The document is signed by the Governor, County Secretary and the petitioner.",
            "\t\t Section 67 of the County Governments Act provides that an appointment shall be evidenced in writing as opposed to being in writing. What this means is that an appointment may be contained in a letter of appointment or evidenced from a document or a series of documents in writing. It would therefore seem to me that the petitioner's appointment was evidenced in writing by the document titled “Oath of office of the chairman of the Embu County Public Service Board” signed by the Governor, County Secretary and the petitioner. In any event the oath would be superfluous and of no effect if taken by a person whose appointment was still under process.",
            "\t\t Regarding the issue of gazettment of the appointment, the Court of Appeal, albeit indirectly, recently dealt with the issue in the case of Nderitu Gachagua vs Dr. Thuo Mathenge & 2 others Civil Appeal No. 14 of 2013 (Nyeri). The question there was whether the requirement by section 76(1)(a) of the Election Act which requires election results to be gazetted for them to be valid was inconsistent with article 87(2) of the Constitution. While holding that the provision was not unconstitutional, the court observed that the Gazette is an official document of the Government of Kenya in which official matters including official notices by the Government are published. Any notice published in the Gazette is deemed as notice to the general public and one is barred from pleading ignorance of the same.",
            "\t\tBesides section 85 of the Evidence Act provides (in paraphrase) that “...the production of a copy of the Gazette containing any notice purporting to be made in pursuance of a written law...shall be prima facie evidence in all courts and for all purposes whatsoever of making and tenor of such...notice.” What this implies is that, in absence of proof to the contrary, the Gazette notice becomes a formal expression of the existence of the notice or law in question. The Gazette does not as it were constitute the notice or the law itself but rather the official announcement of its existence or coming into force. Such that the validity or otherwise of a law or notice is not resident in the Gazette but the persons or bodies tasked with the responsibility to make such laws or issue such notices in accordance with the law and the Constitution. The Gazette merely confers a seal of authority or officialdom to existence of the notice or the law.",
            "\t\tConcerning the issuance of a letter of appointment, Mr. Kibe Mungai submitted that the petitioner was never issued with a letter of appointment for him to be accused of declining to sign the same. Mr. Njoroge on his part did not offer any evidence to the contrary. The only attachments in the affidavit of Margaret Lorna Kamau in opposition to the petition which could be said to be close to dealing with the petitioner's terms of service were, the notice of advertisement of the position of the Chair of the County Assembly (MLK1), a letter on remuneration structure for the County Public Service Board addressed to Mr. Kinuthia Mwangi of Transitional Authority(MLK2), Advisory on Human Resource Management from Transitional Authority(MLK3), internal Memo on County Book from County Coordinator (MLK4) and a letter dated 3rd September, 2013 by the petitioner to the Governor concerning contract of service for the  Chairperson of the County Public Service Board (MLK5). The rest of the attachments concern the reason and the process of removal of the petitioner. In fact the import of the relevant depositions in the affidavit of Margaret Lorna Kamau in opposition to the petition were that no such letter was issued as  according to her, the petitioner asked for a higher entry level pay than was authorized by the Salaries and  Remuneration Commission, the reason for which his removal was done.",
            "\t\tIn concluding this issue, the court observes that the relationship between the petitioner and the 1st respondent is that of an Employer and employee hence principally governed by Employment Act and other relevant legislation. Section 9 (2) of  the Employment Act provides that “...an employer who is a party to a written contract of service shall be responsible for causing the contract to be drawn up stating particulars of the employment and that the contract is consented to by the employee...” Section 10 further provides that “...a written contract of service specified in section 9 shall...be given not later than two months after the beginning of employment.",
            "\t\t From the foregoing, the duty was cast upon the 1st respondent to issue the petitioner with a letter of appointment hence it is contradictory for it argue that because the petitioner declined to approve of the sums set by the SRC as salary, no such letter could be issued and further that his appointment was incomplete for want of letter of appointment and or Gazettment.  It would have been tidier for the respondent to draw the letter of appointment and confront the petitioner with it for him to decline instead of declining to issue one simply because in their opinion  the appointment process was incomplete.",
            "\t\t The next question to be dealt with at this stage is whether the disputed removal of the petitioner as the chair of 3rd respondent violated the constitutional and statutory provisions and procedure. That is to say: did the disputed removal comply with the provisions of section 58(5) of the County Government Act in terms of grounds and procedure?",
            "\t\tSection 58(5) provides that the members of the Board may be removed from office on grounds set out for the removal of members of a constitutional commission under article 251(1) of the Constitution; and by a vote of not less than 75% of all the members of the County Assembly.",
            "\t\tArticle 251. (1) provides:  A member of a commission (other than an ex officio member), or the holder of an independent office, may be removed from office only for—",
            "\t(a) serious violation of this Constitution or any other law,",

            "\t(d) incompetence; or",
            "\t(e) bankruptcy.",
            "\t\tBy a letter dated 2nd September, 2013 (MLK6) the 2nd respondent wrote to the County Assembly speaker requesting for the revocation of the petitioner's appointment for the reasons:",

            "\t\tAs a consequence of the 2nd respondent's request, the County Assembly on 4th September, 2013 approved the motion to the effect that:",
            "\t“...Pursuant to standing order No. 47(2)(a) of the standing orders of the County Assembly of Embu and upon the advise of H.E the Governor vide letter ref: EBU/CG/CEC/Col.1/5 dated 2nd September, 2013, this Assembly rescinds its decision of 10th July, 2013 at 2.30 pm, Order No. 9 in respect of recommendation 1(i). (this motion has been approved by the Committee on Appointments).",
            "\t\tThis resolution was communicated to the 2nd responded by the Speaker of the Assembly through a letter dated 4th September, 2013 and who in turn communicated to the petitioner through a letter dated 5th September, 2013.",
            "\t\tWhereas the Constitution and the County Government Act talks of removal, the 2nd respondent's letter asked the Assembly to rescind its decision to appoint the petitioner as the Chair of Embu County Public Service. In order to avoid technicalities and absurd results, the Court will for the purposes of doing justice to this dispute, construe rescission to mean removal.",
            "\t\tAs stated above article 251. (1) provides that a member of a commission (other than an ex officio member), or the holder of an independent office, may be removed from office only  for a serious violation of the Constitution or any other law, including a contravention of Chapter Six; gross misconduct, whether in the performance of the member’s or office holder’s functions or otherwise; physical or mental incapacity to perform the functions of office; incompetence; or bankruptcy.",
            "\t\tThis provision unlike other provisions circumscribe the  reasons for removal of a member of a commission other than an ex officio member. To this extent, the reason for removal must be strictly be within the parameters set by article 251(1).",
            "\t\tWhat the foregoing implies is that it was the duty of the 1st and 2nd respondent to demonstrate that the reasons cited in the 2nd respondents letter dated 30th September, 2013 fitted within one or more of the parameters set under article 251(1) of the Constitution. That is to say whereas article 251(1) may be exclusive in terms of parameters for removal, the factual fit or justification for such removal is left to the body or persons tasked with such removal to align them with the exclusive parameters set by the constitution.",
            "\t\tNeither the 2nd respondent's letter dated 30th September, 2013 nor the resolution of the Assembly passed on 4th September, 2013 can be said to have at least attempted the factual fit or justification contemplated by article 251(1) of the Constitution. In fact the Assembly merely regurgitated the 2nd respondent's letter without showing in what was the petitioner violated the provisions of article 251(1). This far, the Court reaches the inevitable conclusion that the removal of the petitioner was for reasons outside the contemplation of article 251(1) of the constitution hence null and void to that extent.",
            "\t\tOn the question of procedure, no evidence was exhibited either by the petitioner or the any of the respondents that the purported removal was in accordance with section 58(5)(b) which provides that such removal shall be conducted by not less than 75% of the members of the County Assembly. The court will therefore delve no further.",
            "\t\t The next issue will now be: among the fleet of remedies sought by the petitioner which is the most appropriate in the event that the court reaches the conclusion that the petition is successful? Before delving into the issue, the Court expressed concern at the hearing about the number and possible duplicity of issues and prayers by the petitioner. The Court recalled asking Mr. Mungai to collapse the issues and prayers into a manageable number which he graciously agreed. However the Court would like to sound  a caution to litigants and their advocates to resist the rapidly growing tendency to bombard the Court with lengthy and voluminous pleadings even where such elaborate and voluminous paper work is not necessary. Good pleadings are those that are lean, concise and to the point. It may be enough to say that a time has come when the Court should exercise an order for exemplary costs in cases where litigants file inordinately lengthy and or voluminous pleadings.",
            "\t\tThe above having been said, the 1st and 3rd respondents are public bodies while the 2nd respondent is a public official. The 2nd respondent exercises some of his power with the approval of the County Assembly which is a component of the Embu County Government. To this extent the remedy as against the 1st respondent and ipso facto the County Assembly in so far as its resolution passed on 4th September, 2013 is concerned is that of certiorari while as against the 2nd and 3rd respondent is an order of injunction.",
            "\t\tHowever in granting the reliefs whose consequence is to keep in service, an employee in a strained relationship with an employer, the Court is very much conscious of the common law principle against specific performance in employment contracts unless in exceptional cases. The principle against specific performance in employment contracts is premised on the fact that employment relationships are in most cases personal in nature. Therefore the moment the minimum necessary confidence between the parties has been severely eroded, that relationship cannot reasonably continue without a considerable degree of awkwardness.",
            "\t\tThe common law principle against specific performance in employment contracts must however align itself to the law and the constitution. Section 58(5)(a) read together with article 251(1) provides for the procedure and reasons for which a County Public Service Commission member may be removed from office. In fact article 251(1) if read strictly appears to provide an exclusive compendium of grounds only for which a member of a commission may be removed. To this extent a court of law will not shy away from decreeing that an employee cannot be removed otherwise as provided by law and more so the constitution simply because that would be against the common law principle leaning against specific performance in employment contract.",
            "\t\tRemoval from office or loss of employment for that matter is a very drastic step especially in a country like ours where jobs are hard to come by. But it can be done where circumstances demand so. However those tasked with such responsibility are enjoined both by law and good conscience to act in good faith and in accordance with the law.

            "\t\tTherefore having found that the purported removal of the petitioner contravened, in terms of reasons for removal, article 251(1) of the Constitution, this Court declares such removal null and void and proceeds to issue an order of certiorari to quash the resolution of the County Assembly passed on  4th September, 2013 rescinding its earlier decision appointing the petitioner as the Chair of the Embu County Government.",
            "\t\tThe Court further issues an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the 2nd respondent rescinding the appointment of the petitioner as the Chair of the Embu County Government contained in the letter dated 5th September, 2013.",

            "RULING",
            "1.   In this suit, Thermos Hong Kong Ltd (T.H.K or the 1st Plaintiff) and Nabico Enterprises Ltd (Nabico or the 2nd Plaintiff), allege a threat of or actual infringement on Trademarks Nos. 567, 568, 569, 570, 571 and 22376.  The alleged infringer, Doshi Ironmongers Limited (Doshi or the Defendant), not only denies the allegations but, by way of counter claim, seeks, inter alia, an expungement and revocation of the assignment and registration of those Trademarks.  These will be amongst other matters that the Trial Court will be called upon to hear and determine.",
            "2. For now, T.H.K and Nabico invite this Court, through a Notice of Motion dated 28th July 2020, to grant them the following orders:-",
            "(d)  THAT pending the hearing and determination of this suit a temporary order of injunction be issued restraining the Defendant (whether acting by its servants or agents or any of them or otherwise howsoever) from infringing on the First Plaintiff’s Registered Trade Marks Nos. 567, 568, 569, 570, 571 and 22376 and interfering with the Plaintiff’s rights to import and sell goods bearing the mark ‘THERMOS’ in Kenya.",
            "(e)  THAT pending the hearing and determination of this suit a temporary order of injunction be issued restraining the Defendant (whether acting by its servants or agents or any of them or otherwise howsoever) from advertising or communicating to the public through print and social media that it has the exclusive right to use the trade marks ‘THERMOS’.",
            "3. At this interlocutory stage the Court resists any invitation to make firm findings on contested issues that are premised on untested evidence.  That is a call for the Trial Court. A brief background to the dispute.",
            "4. Although Doshi impugns their validity, T.H.K is registered as the proprietor of Trademarks No. 567 Thermos (word) in class 21, 568 Thermos (word) in class 14, 569 Thermos (word) in class 21, 570 Thermos (word) in class 21 and 571 Thermos (word) in classes 2, 14, 18, 20, 22, 26, 29, and 34.    The more controversial one is that it is the registered holder of Trademark No. 22736 Thermos (word + device) in class 21.",
            "5. T.H.K also states that it has been selling flasks, bottles and culinary utensils bearing the Trademark “THERMOS” since 1920 and that by virtue of long use, the marks have been in the Kenya for almost a century and are well known marks in accordance with section 15A of the Trade Marks Act.",
            "6. The Plaintiffs are aggrieved by two advertisements placed by the Doshi in two newspapers; of 17th June 2020 in the ‘Daily Nation’ and of 23rd July 2020 in the ‘Standard’.  The contents of these two advertisements, which are at the heart of the Motion before Court, are discussed in greater detail later in this decision.  The Plaintiffs sees these as acts of infringement or interference.",
            "7. A further complaint by the Plaintiffs is that in a letter dated 23rd July 2020, the Defendant’s lawyers Olunga & Co. Advocates wrote to Nabico demanding that it (Nabico) should immediately cease the importation, distribution and trading its “Thermos” branded goods and directing it to recall the goods from the market.",
            "8. Ultimately, the Plaintiffs seeks the following orders:-",
            "a) A declaration that the Defendant is not entitled to interference or restrain the use of the THERMOS mark by the First Plaintiff by virtue of the First Plaintiff having continuously used the mark in accordance with Section 7 and 10 of the Trademarks Act.",
            "b) A permanent injunction to restrain the Defendant, whether by itself, its directors, officers, employees, or agents from infringing on the First Plaintiff’s Registered Trademarks Nos. 567, 568, 569, 570, 571 and 22376.",
            "c) A declaration that the threats made by the Defendant in its letter dated 23rd July 2020 and the advertisement in the Standard of 23rd July 2020 contravene the First Plaintiff’s rights under Sections 7 and 10 of the Trademarks Act.",
            "d) A permanent injunction to restrain the Defendant from interfering with the First Plaintiff’s sale its goods to any retailers in respect of goods sold under TM 567, 568, 569, 570, and 22376 in respect to the mark ‘THERMOS’ Under Section 10 of the Trademark Act.",
            "e) A permanent injunction to restrain the Defendant from publishing any material in the print and social media in respect of the First Plaintiff’s TM 567, 568, 569, 570, and 22376 in respect to the mark ‘THERMOS’.",
            "f) Costs of this suit.",
            "g) Any further or other order as this Honourable Court may deem fit.",
            "9.  Doshi resists the claim by the Plaintiffs.  Doshi’s case is that T.H.K obtained registration of the trademarks fraudulently, illegally and irregularly.  Doshi sets out what it sees as the particulars of fraud and illegality in paragraph 5 of the Defence and again in its Counterclaim.",
            "10. Regarding Trade Mark No. 22376, Doshi’s case is that the Trademark is a device and not word, more specifically that it is THERMOS SUN AND SNOWFLAKE (device) and not THERMOS (word).  Featuring as a linchpin of the Defence is that Trademark 22736 is not an independent Trademark but is associated with Trademark No. 17003 which has since been quashed.",
            "11.  Doshi asserts that Trademark No. 17003 was taken away from T.H.K through a Judgment in Mombasa Civil Appeal No. 251 of 2017 and has since been registered in the name of Doshi under new registration as Trademark No. 59464 ‘THERMOS’ in class 21.  It argues that Trademark No. 22376 cannot be separated from Trademark No. 17003 whose ownership and all Trademarks associated with it has already been determined by the High Court and is now pending in the Court of Appeal.",
            "12. It is the case of Doshi that T.H.K’s claim over Trademark No. 22376 is dogged by illegality and fraud. For example, that T.H.K. is not a proper assignee of the mark as the Deed of Assignment of 21 November 2011 is for Trademark 22356 and not 22376. ",
            "13. Doshi defends the two publications and its advocate’s letter as being truthful. It then seeks the following orders in the Counterclaim:-",
            "1. A declaration that the assignment and subsequent registration of Trademarks Numbers Nos. 567, 568, 569, 570, 571 and 22376 “THERMOS” in Classes 13, 14, 15, 16, 50 and 21 respectively in the name of THERMOS HONG KONG LIMITED is illegal, null and void.",
            "2. Assignment, registration and entry into the Register of THERMOS HONG KONG LIMITED as the proprietor of Trademarks Numbers Nos. 567, 568, 569, 570, 571 and 22376 “THERMOS” in Classes 13, 14, 15, 16, 50 and 21 respectively be and is hereby expunged  and revoked forthwith.",
            "3. An order be and is hereby issued directing the Registrar of Trademarks or any authorized officer to rectify the register by removing and expunging the names of THERMOS HONG KONG LIMITED therefrom as the proprietor of Trademarks Numbers Nos. 567, 568, 569, 570, 571 and 22376 “THERMOS” in Classes 13, 14, 15, 16, 50 and 21 respectively.",
            "4. There be and is hereby issued an order of permanent injunction to restrain THERMOS HONG KONG LIMITED and NABICO ENTERPRISES LIMITED and/or their agents, employees, assigns or any other person acting on their behalf from manufacturing, importing, distributing, selling, stocking/marketing, advertising, publishing or in any other way dealing with goods, items and products under Trademarks Numbers Nos. 567, 568, 569, 570, 571 and 22376 “THERMOS”.",
            "5. There be and is hereby issued an order of permanent injunction to restrain THERMOS HONG KONG LIMITED and NABICO ENTERPRISES LIMITED and/or their agents, employees, assigns or any other person acting on their behalf from infringing on or any other way interfering with the Plaintiff’s Trademark No. 59464 “THERMOS” (word) in Class 21.",
            "6. Costs of this Counterclaim be paid by the Defendants jointly and severally.",
            "7. Any other and further relief this Court may deem just to grant.",
            "14. The Court has considered the issues raised and the submissions of counsel in this matter.  Although the arguments may have been somewhat lengthy, the Court thinks the matters raised at this interlocutory stage to be much narrower and does not intend to rehash the arguments made.",
            "15. This is an application for temporary orders of injunction and the principles set out in Giella vs Cassman Brown 1973 E.A. 358 stand out as the true north.",
            "16. While the Plaintiffs seek to rely on the registration of the Trademarks to press for this Court’s protection, the Defendant’s Defence and Counterclaim question the validity of those marks and indeed seek their expungement.  Yet for now, and before a pronouncement is made as to the propriety or otherwise of their registration and/or assignment, section 46 of the Trademark’s Act (the Act) has a place at this interlocutory stage.  It reads:-",
            "“Registration to be prima facie evidence of validity;",
            "In all legal proceedings relating to a registered trade mark (including applications under section 35), the fact that a person is registered as proprietor of the trade mark shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the original registration of the trade mark and of all subsequent assignments and transmissions thereof.”",
            "17. At this stage of the proceedings the Court will not be making a verdict on the rectitude or impropriety  of the process leading to the registration of Trademarks now in the name of T.H.K. and has to accept that the registration of those Trademarks as revealed in the certificates for use in legal proceedings annexed to the affidavit of Alex Huang sworn on 28th July 2020 as prima facie evidence of the validity of the original registrations of the Trademarks and of all subsequent assignments and transmissions. And I need to say a little more regarding Trademark 22376. One argument by Doshi is T.H.K was assigned Trademark 22356 and not 22376. On the other hand, T.H.K states that the deed of assignment had an error and the true number is reflected in registration certificate. Again, at this stage, the Court must fall back to the certificate for use which gives proprietorship of Trademark No 22376 to T.H.K. Another reason why this matter need not hold the Court much longer is because a plank of the Defence and Court proceeds on the premise the T.H.K is the proprietor of the Trademark and even prayers that it be expunged from the register. A clear concession that Trademark No 22376 exists and its registered proprietor through assignment or otherwise is T.H.K.",
            "18. The next issue for this Court’s consideration is in respect to which class the Trademarks are registered.  This is because the Plaintiff pleaded change of class.  In Paragraph 10 of the Defence, the Defendant states that Trademark No. 567 is for class 13, No. 568 for class 14, No. 569 for class 15, No. 570 for class 16 and No. 571 for class 50 and that the listed classes have never changed and remain the same to date.",
            "19. The law is that under the provisions of Section 6 of the Act, a Trade Mark is registered in respect of particular goods or services which are classified in accordance with the international classification of goods and services and any figurative elements of the mark in accordance with the International Classification of the Figurative Elements of Marks. Section 6 reads;",
            "“6. (1) A trade mark shall be registered in respect of particular goods or services, which shall be classified in the manner specified in subsection (2).",
            "(2) The goods and services in respect of which registration of a mark is applied for shall be classified in accordance with the International Classification of Goods and Services and any figurative elements of the mark shall be classified in accordance with the International Classification of the Figurative Elements of Marks:",
            "Provided that where goods or services belonging to several classes according to the International Classification of Goods and Services have been included in the same application, the Registrar shall incorporate the several classes of goods and services for the purpose of registration.”",
            "To be noted is that the classification may be revised and amended from time to time.",
            "20. On this matter the Plaintiff produced a list of classes of the Nice classification, 11th Edition 2018.  By dint of the provisions of Section 54A, this Court has power to receive this list as evidence, Section 54A reads:-",
            "“Nice Agreement receivable in evidence;",
            "The Nice Agreement concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the purpose of the Registration of Trade Marks of 15 June, 1957 and all revisions thereof together with the publications of the World Intellectual Property Organization of Geneva relating to the Agreement may be received in evidence before any court or Registrar and shall be taken into account by the Registrar in relation to his duties under this Act.”",
            "21. My finding therefore is that there is prima facie evidence that the 1st Plaintiff is registered as the propriety of the following Trademarks; No. 567 Thermos (word) in class 21, 568 Thermos (word) in class 14, 569 Thermos (word) in class 21, 570 Thermos (word) in class 21 and 571 Thermos (word) in classes 2, 14, 18, 20, 22, 26, 29, and 34.",
            "22. The Court then narrows down its attention to Trademark No 22376 which received a more vicious attack. In addition to what this Court has already discussed concerning this Trademark, there is a contest as to what it protects. The Plaintiff states that it protects Thermos (word and device) while the Defendant is emphatic that it is only in respect to THERMOS (word).  In pressing its proposition, the Defendant, through the replying affidavit of Ashok Labhshanker Doshi sworn on 18th August 2020 gives what it understands as events leading to registration of that mark.",
            "23. The Trial Court will obviously have occasion to interrogate the allegation with some detail, if called upon.  For now, I have to rely on the certificate of use for legal proceedings and what it tells the Court.  The certificate displayed by the Plaintiff shows that this Trademark is in respect to both device and word ‘Thermos’.",
            "24. There is then the argument that Trademark No. 22376 is not an independent Trademark but is associated with Trademark No. 17003 registered in the name of the Defendant.  To this argument, the Plaintiff points out that Section 26 of the Act was repealed and so after the repeal, the inter-associations for each THERMOS mark became redundant and fell away. ",
            "25. The repealed Section 26 read as follows:-",
            "“S26. (1) Trademarks that are registered as, or that are deemed by virtue of this Act to be, associated trademarks shall be assigned and transmissible only as a whole and not separately, but they shall for all other purposes be deemed to have been registered as separate trademarks.",
            "(2) Where a trade mark that is registered, or is the subject of an application for registration, in respect of any goods is identical with another trade mark that is registered, or is the subject of an application for registration, in the name of the same proprietor in respect of the same goods or description of goods, or so nearly resembles it as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion if used by a person other than the trade marks shall be entered on the register as associated trademarks.",
            "(3) Where a trade mark and any part or parts thereof are, by virtue of subsection (1) of section 24, registered as separate trade marks in the name of the same proprietor, they shall be deemed to be and shall be registered as, associated trademarks.",
            "(4) All trademarks that are, by virtue of subsection (2) of section 24, registered as a series in one registration shall be deemed to be, and shall be registered as, associated trademarks.",
            "(5) On application made in the prescribed manner by the registered proprietor of two or more trademarks registered as associated trademarks, the Registrar may dissolve the association as respects any of them if he is satisfied that there would be no likelihood of deception of confusions being caused if that trade mark were used by another person in relation to any of the goods in respect of which it is registered, and may amend the register accordingly.",
            "(6) A decision of the Registrar under subsection (2) or (5) shall be subject to appeal to the court.”",
            "26. Counsel Opiyo for the Plaintiff made a further contention that even under the repealed Section 26, associated marks were only to be deemed associated for purposes of assignment. For all other purposes they were deemed to be separate Trademarks. Counsel then suggested that the rationale for the repealed Section 26 was that associated marks had to be transferred or assigned together and to the same assignee to prevent a situation where different parties would be registered as owners of similar marks for the same goods or services thus causing confusion.",
            "27. Counsel Olunga for the Defendant takes a divergent view.  Counsel submits that Trademark No. 22376 does not stand alone but is associated with Trademark No. 17003 which had been registered far much earlier and which is the parent Trademark.",
            "28. Regarding the effect of Section 26 of the Act, counsel asserts that the repeal of that provision which took place in 2002 cannot be cited as a reason to defeat the association of the two Trademarks which was created in 1976, at registration of Trademark No. 22376.",
            "29. Counsel makes the point that because there were no transitional provisions in the Act as far as the repeal is concerned then section 23 of the Interpretation and General Provision Act will aid the Court in determining whether the repeal of the section affects things done prior to the repeal.  Counsel argues that by dint of section 23(3) (b) and (c) it is clear that the repeal did not affect what was duly done under the repealed law.",
            "30. As to the effect of Section 26, the Defendant takes the position that it is clear that for purposes of assignment and transmission, associated trademarks must be treated as a whole but for any other purpose they are deemed as separate marks.",
            "31. There is, I think, consensus that when section 26 was repealed by Act 4 of 2002 no accompanying transitional provisions were made.  Therefore, as correctly proposed by the Defendant, section 23 of the Interpretation and General Provision Act assists in determining whether anything done prior to the repeal survived the repeal.  Section 23 reads:-",
            "“Provisions respecting amended written law, and effect of repealing written law;",
            "(1) Where in a written law a reference is made to another written law, that reference shall, except where the context otherwise requires, be deemed to include a reference to the last-mentioned written law as it may from time to time be amended.",
            "(2) Where a written law repeals and re-enacts, with or without modification, a provision of a former written law, references in another written law to the provisions so repealed shall, unless a contrary intention appears, be construed as references to the provision so re-enacted.",
            "(3) Where a written law repeals in whole or in part another written law, then, unless a contrary intention appears the repeal shall not—",
            "(a) revive anything not in force or existing at the time at which the repeal takes effect; or",
            "(b) affect the previous operation of a written law so repealed or anything duly done or suffered under a written law so repealed; or",
            "(c) affect a right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under a written law so repealed; or",
            "(d) affect a penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of an offence committed against a written law so repealed; or",
            "(e) affect an investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of a right, privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid, and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, and any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed, as if the repealing written law had not been made.”",
            "32. It is common ground therefore that by dint of section 23(3) (b) and (c) of the Interpretation and General Provision Act the repeal of section 26 did not affect anything duly done or suffered to be done under those provisions nor did it affect a right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the repealed law.  There is therefore little contention that if section 26 affected the association between Trademark No. 22376 and Trademark No. 17003 prior to the repeal then the same continues to hold to date, even after the repeal.",
            "33. So as to understand the true effect of subsection (1) of the repealed law, it is necessary to set out the entire provision of the repealed Section 26:-",
            "“S26. (1) Trademarks that are registered as, or that are deemed by virtue of this Act to be, associated trademarks shall be assigned and transmissible only as a whole and not separately, but they shall for all other purposes be deemed to have been registered as separate trademarks.",
            "(2) Where a trade mark that is registered, or is the subject of an application for registration, in respect of any goods is identical with another trade mark that is registered, or is the subject of an application for registration, in the name of the same proprietor in respect of the same goods or description of goods, or so nearly resembles it as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion if used by a person other than the trade marks shall be entered on the register as associated trademarks.",
            "(3) Where a trade mark and any part or parts thereof are, by virtue of subsection (1) of section 24, registered as separate trade marks in the name of the same proprietor, they shall be deemed to be and shall be registered as, associated trademarks.",
            "(4) All trademarks that are, by virtue of subsection (2) of section 24, registered as a series in one registration shall be deemed to be, and shall be registered as, associated trademarks.",
            "(5) On application made in the prescribed manner by the registered proprietor of two or more trademarks registered as associated trademarks, the Registrar may dissolve the association as respects any of them if he is satisfied that there would be no likelihood of deception of confusions being caused if that trade mark were used by another person in relation to any of the goods in respect of which it is registered, and may amend the register accordingly.",
            "(6) A decision of the Registrar under subsection (2) or (5) shall be subject to appeal to the court.”",
            "34. My understanding of the repealed subsection (1) is that, generally, associated Trademarks are deemed to be registered as separate Trademarks.  However, where a proprietor desires to assign or transmit the associated Trademarks then they cannot be assigned or transmitted separately.  They can only be assigned or transmitted as a whole.  The associated Trademarks are joined at the hip for purposes of assignment and transmission.",
            "35. That said if the proprietor wishes to assign or transmit any of the associated Trademarks separately then the proprietor would have to seek that the association be first dissolved in respect to the Trademark sought to be assigned or transmitted separately. Under Subsection 5 the Registrar may accede to the dissolution of the association if satisfied that there would be no likelihood of deception or confusion being caused if the Trademarks were used by another person in relation to any or the goods in respect of which it is registered.  And as explained by Kerly's Law of Trademarks and Trade Names Thirteenth Edition there lies the entire object of the repealed law on associated Trademarks:-",
            "“This requirement reflected the whole purpose of association, which was to avoid the same or similar marks being used on the same or similar goods by different people.”",
            "36. Nothing in those provisions suggest that an associated Trademark, which is generally deemed to be a separate Trademark, should cease to exist when its associates (whether a parent mark) cease to exist. To the contrary, by contemplation of subsection 5, there will be instances where associated Trademarks can exist as separate marks without causing likelihood of deception or confusion. Applied here, it may be that although Trademark no 22376 and Trademark No 17003 are associated, they can be used by two different people without the apprehension of deception or confusion.",
            "37. The anxiety of Doshi is that as the owner of the Trademark No. 17003 which was found to be suitable for association with Trademark No. 22376, leaving the two Trademarks in the hands of two different proprietors may lead to confusion. Yet given my perception of the law the answer to that anxiety lies in the Defendant seeking, as it has done in the Counterclaim, for expungement or revocation of Trademark No. 22376.  The answer is not to restore to self-help or extrajudicial action.",
            "38. Now, do the two publications amount to an interference or infringement of the 1st Plaintiff’s Trademarks?  This discussion requires that the two publications be reproduced in their entirety.  The publication of 23rd July 2020 reads as follows:-",
            "“PUBLIC NOTICE",
            "DOSHI IRONMONGERS LIMITED’s attention has been drawn to a Public Notice put up by Kaplan & Stratton Advocates at page 6 of the Daily Nation newspaper of 22nd June 2020.",
            "DOSHI IRONMONGERS LIMITED wishes to reiterate the contents of its newspaper advertisement published in the Daily Nation newspaper of 17th June 2020 at page 20, and to inform the public of the following facts:",
            "DOSHI IRONGMONGERSLIMITED is the sole registered proprietor of the Trade Mark Number 59464 “THERMOS” in Class 21 as depicted below:",
            "[IMAGE]",
            "Class: 21 (Plastic Flask Household Items).",
            "The Certificate of Registration of the said Trade Mark “THERMOS” was issued to DOSHI IRONMONGERS LIMITED by the Registrar of Trade Marks on 15th May 2020. DOSHI IRONMONGERS LIMITED therefore has the exclusive license and right to use and deal with the said Trade Mark “THERMOS” in relation to the above named items in Kenya. ",
            "The allegation contained in the Notice by Kaplan & Stratton Advocates that Thermos Hong Kong Limited is the registered owner of Trade Mark NO 22376 THERMOS (word and device) for goods in Class 21 including flasks and insulated containers is not supported by facts, law and evidence because of the following reasons;",
            "1.  The registration of Trade Mark “THERMOS” is Class 21 in favour of Thermos Hong Kong Limited was quashed by the High Court in Mombasa in CIVIL APPEAL NO. 251 OF 2017 The Trade Mark is no longer registered in the name of Thermos Hong Kong Limited. ",
            "2.  Pursuant to the order of the High Court in Mombasa the Registrar of Trade Marks proceeded to issue Certificate of Registration of Trade Mark “THERMOS” in Class 21 in the name of DOSHI IRONMONGERS LIMITED.",
            "3.  An attempt by Thermos Hong Kong Limited through Kaplan & Stratton Advocates to recall the Certificate of Registration issued DOSHI IRON MONGERS LIMITED was rejected by the Registrar of Trade Marks.",
            "4. According to documents filed in court by Kaplan & Stratton Advocates Trade Mark No. 22376 which Thermos Hong Kong Limited purports to own IS NOT the word “THERMOS” but “SUN & SNOW FLAKE DEVICE” which in any event belonged to a different Company and has never been assigned to Thermos Hong Kong Limited.",
            "The facts contained in this Notice are available for verification with the Registrar Trade Marks at the High Court of Kenya in Mombasa and with our advocates M/S OLUGA & COMPANY ADVOCATES.

            "In the meantime members of the public are notified that DOSHI IRONMONGERS LIMITED is the registered owner of Trade Mark Number 59464 “THERMOS” in Class 21 (Plastic Flask Household Items).",

            "DOSHI IRONMONGERS LIMITED”",
            "39.

            "40. The same can be said of the publication of 17th June 2020 when it suggests that only Doshi has exclusive use of THERMOS trademarks. It which reads:-",
            "“PUBLIC ALERT",
            "Notice is hereby given that DOSHI IRONMONGERS LIMITED is the sole registered proprietor of the Trade Mark Number 59464 “THERMOS” in Class 21 as depicted below:",

The Court’s repeated authoritative pronouncements in that regard and the principles from the precedents would suffice, as a guide, to litigants who sought to invoke the Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction. Those principles were applicable in equal measure to electoral disputes that had escalated to the Court of Appeal. However, it appeared that the Court may have established some kind of exception, regarding election petitions, in so far as the scope of article 163 (4) (a) was concerned in the Munya, Outa and Kidero decisions.\n\n\t\tThose pronouncements by the Supreme Court were not only jurisprudentially sound, but conceptually logical as they aptly captured the architecture of the 2010 Constitution. However, the Munya, Outa and Kidero decisions should not be taken to mean, that somehow, they gave a carte blanche for admitting appeals, from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court in election petitions.\n\n\t\tThe Munya case was the first one, in which both the High Court and Court of Appeal had to grapple with the meaning, scope, and applicability of articles 81 and 86 of the Constitution as they tested the integrity of that particular election. It was concluded, that the issue of the applicability of articles 81 and 86 of the Constitution, in so far as determining the accuracy and verifiability of that particular election was alive, throughout the proceedings in the two Superior Courts. As the parties had taken opposite views on how the two courts had navigated that fundamental question, the Supreme Court decided, that it had to weigh it under article 163 (4) (a) of the Constitution.\n\n\t\tThe petition of appeal did not meet the threshold to be admitted under article 163(4) (a) of the Constitution, examination of the proceedings at the trial Court and Court of Appeal had not established that the determination of the petition turned on the interpretation and application of the Constitution. What the petitioner was doing was to introduce constitutional questions in his memorandum of appeal that none of the two Superior Courts dealt with in arriving at their decisions. The Court was being invited to interpret provisions of the Constitution in a vacuum, a task for which the Court could hardly have been established. There had to be a real controversy relating to how the Appellate Court interpreted and applied the Constitution to trigger the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction under article 163 (4).\n\n\t\tThe Court assumed jurisdiction over the petition because it involved the application of the verifiability test under article 86 of the Constitution, in regard to the Recount/ Scrutiny Report and therefore fell within the ambit of article 163(4)(a) of the Constitution.\n\n\t\tAn order for scrutiny or re-count could be made following a request by any of the parties, at any stage, after the filing of a petition, before the determination of the petition. However, the party applying for an order of scrutiny, had to establish a basis for such a request by way of pleadings, affidavits, or evidence adduced during the trial. The trial Court, in issuing an order for scrutiny or recount should ideally confine itself to the specifics of the application.\n\n\t\tA trial Court could issue an order for scrutiny or recount suo motu, if it considered that such an order, could aid it in arriving at a just and fair determination of the petition. However, that discretion had to be exercised sparingly, and should be informed by the pleadings or evidence. The trial Court should record the reasons for such an order, always bearing in mind that, at the end of the day, the case belonged to the petitioner.\n\n\t\tA scrutiny or recount exercise was to be triggered by an application by any of the parties to the dispute. If made suo motu, it should still be informed by the pleadings and evidence adduced during the hearing. The scrutiny or recount exercise was not meant to be a fishing expedition to aid the petitioner. It was intended to aid the Court in verifying and establishing the validity of the vote. It followed that the trial Court ought to confine itself to the claims that necessitated the scrutiny or recount in the first place. Were the Court to have the liberty of making conclusions from the scrutiny report, that were not based on the pleadings, that would open a Pandora’s box whereby courts of law, would be turned into automatic sounding boards for election losers.\n\n\t\tParties were entitled to make submissions on the content of the scrutiny or recount report. The submissions were intended to solidify or controvert the claims on which the scrutiny or recount exercise was based. The submissions were not meant to introduce new evidence that went beyond the scope of the petition. The trial Court should consider those submissions just as any others made during the hearing.\n\n\t\t In addition, a scrutiny or recount report was that which was prepared by the Registrar, signed by all the parties, and formally tabled before Court. The report should confine itself to the claims on which the order for scrutiny was based, or the specific directions given by the trial Court, when issuing the order for scrutiny suo motu. Any document that was not so prepared and signed ought not to be considered as part of the Scrutiny Report. The Scrutiny Report formed part of the proceedings of the Court.\n\n\t\tBased on the law, purpose and process of scrutiny, the Deputy Registrar’s hand written notes were not part of what was formally tabled before the Court. The contents of the hand written notes clearly introduced matters that could not have been responded to by the respondents as they were not part of the pleadings. It was also obvious that the hand written notes were not part of the Scrutiny and Recount Report properly so understood.\n\n\t\tWhat was before the Court of Appeal, was not necessarily the veracity of the contents of the handwritten notes by the Deputy Registrar, but whether the said notes could be considered as forming part of the Scrutiny Report. Such a question was clearly not one of fact but of law. Secondly, the Court of Appeal had to interrogate the contents of the handwritten notes to determine their admissibility.\n\n\t\tAs parties were bound by their pleadings, it was quite in order for the Appellate Court to determine whether, the contents of the hand written notes derived from the pleadings. Such an inquiry was not meant to question the Trial Court’s findings of fact, but to determine whether the evidence on which it relied was admissible or not. That question was a matter of law and properly within the Appellate Court’s jurisdiction. Therefore, the Court of Appeal did not act in excess of its jurisdiction.\n\n\t\t Under section 83 of the Elections Act, non-compliance of any written election law did not warrant an election to be nullified as long as it did not affect the result of the election. While there was a variance in the total tally of the votes, all three figures signaled the 3rd respondent as the winner and as such, the issue of tallying could not suffice to vitiate the election.\n\n\n\t \n\nAppeal dismissed\n\nOrders:\n\n\nDeclaration of the result of the election by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission in respect of the Governor for Embu County was upheld.\n\nAt the High Court, costs would be borne as follows: the Petitioner would bear his own costs and those of the 3rd Respondent. The 1st Respondent [IEBC] would bear its own costs. At the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, Each Party would bear its own costs.\n\n\nCases\n\nEast Africa\n\n\t1.Joho & another v  Shahbal & 2 others [2014] 1 KLR 111-(Followed)\n\n\t2.Judicial Service Commission & another v Gladys Boss Shollei [2014] 2 KLR 206 –(Cited)\n\n\t3.Macharia & another v Kenya Commercial Bank & 2 others [2012] 3 KLR 199 –(Followed)\n\n\t4.Magara v  Nyamweya & 2 others  [2010] 1 KLR 136 -(Mentioned)\n\n\t5.Maranga, Peter & another v Joel Omagwa Onyancha Petition No 7 of 2013-(Cited)\n\n\t6.Mohamud, Abdirahman Ibrahim v Mohamed Ahmed Kolosh & 2 others Petition No 26 of 2018-(Followed)\n\n\t7.Munya v  Kithinji & 2 others  [2014] 3 KLR 36 -(Followed)\n\n\t8.Munya, Gatirau Peter v Dickson Mwenda Kithinji & 2 others Petition No 2B of 2014 [2014] eKLR-(Cited)\n\n\t9.Nduttu & 6000 others v Kenya Breweries Limited & 3 others [2012] 2 KLR 804 -(Followed)\n\n\t10.Ngoge v Kaparo & 5 others [2012] 2 KLR 419 -(Followed)\n\n\t11.Obado v Oyugi & 2 others [2014] 3 KLR 91 –(Mentioned)\n\n\t12.Odinga, Raila Amollo v Independent Electoral Boundaries Commission   Presidential Petition No 1 of 2017 –(Followed))\n\n\t13.Outa, Fredrick Otieno v Jared Odoyo Okello & 4 others SC Petition No 10 of 2014; [2014] eKLR -(Explained)\n\n\t14.Waititu, Ferdinand Ndung’u & 4 others [2014] eKLR-(Followed)\n\n15.Wetangula, Moses Masika v Musikari Kombo & 2 others Civil Appeal No 43 of 2013-(Mentioned)\n\nEuropean Court of Human Rights\n\n\t1.

            "JUDGMENT OF THE COURT",
            "A. INTRODUCTION",
            " [1] What is before the Court is a Petition of Appeal dated 7th September, 2018 filed on 12th September, 2018. The appeal is challenging the decision of the Court of Appeal, dated 17th August, 2018, which decision upheld the appeal by the 3rd respondent herein, hence setting aside the High Court Judgment dated 22nd February, 2018 that had annulled the Gubernatorial elections for Embu County in the 8th August, 2017 elections.",
            "B. LITIGATION BACKGROUND",
            "(a) At the High Court",
            "[2] Following the declaration of the 3rdrespondent as the Governor elect for Embu County having garnered 97,760 votes against the petitioner’s 96, 775 votes, the petitioner instituted Embu HC Election Petition No. 1 of 2017, Lenny Maxwell Kivuti v. the Independent Electoral & Boundaries Commission & 3 Others disputing the said declaration.",
            "[3] The petitioner’s case before the High Court was that although the process of casting of ballots in respect of that election was smooth and peaceful, the counting and tallying process was characterized by grave irregularities; that the results were inflated and swapped in favour of the appellant; that Forms 37A were tampered with, at the tallying stations to reflect fictitious figures; that some Forms 37A were not signed by agents; that his agents were barred from participating in the counting and tallying of ballots at the polling stations; and that the counting of the votes was undertaken in a manner that contravened Article 81 of the Constitution, Section 38A of the Elections Act and Regulation 69(2) of the Election (General) Regulations 2012.",
            "[4] The petitioner’s prayers were for a re-tally of the votes cast in Gategi Primary School and New Site polling stations within Mbeere South Constituency, scrutiny and recount of all the votes cast in all polling stations in Manyatta and Runyenjes Constituencies, nullification of the results declared, a declaration that he was the validly elected Governor of Embu County, costs and any other relief that the Court could be pleased to grant.",
            "[5] In response to the petition, the 1st to 4th respondents denied all the allegations by the petitioner and asserted instead, that the gubernatorial election was conducted in accordance with the Constitution and the law; that it was free, fair and transparent; and that the 3rd respondent and the 4th respondent were validly declared the Governor and Deputy Governor, respectively.",
            "[6] At the close of the oral hearing, the petitioner successfully moved the Court on 28th December, 2017 for Orders of partial scrutiny and recount of ballots in several specified polling stations in Mbeere South, Manyatta and Runyenjes Constituencies.  He subsequently successfully applied for review of the said Order, vide a Motion dated 19th January, 2018 to include more polling stations in Manyatta Constituency for a recount of votes. In the result, the Deputy Registrar was further directed to carry out a partial scrutiny of Forms 37A for all polling stations in Mbeere South, Mbeere North, Manyatta and Runyenjes Constituencies. The scrutiny and recount was concluded and a report by the Deputy Registrar, Embu High Court, dated 7th February 2018 duly filed in Court.",
            "[7] The High Court concluded that from the material generated by the scrutiny report, there were irregularities and incidences of non-compliance with the law on elections. The Court therefore set the question for determination as whether those irregularities or non-compliance with the law were of such a degree as to invalidate the election.",
            "[8] In a Judgment dated 22nd February, 2018,  Musyoka J nullified the election of the 3rd respondent. The learned Judge first addressed the issue of unpleaded matters and found that election disputes are sui generis and subject to their own unique procedures and as such an Election Court could look at unpleaded materials that emerge from scrutiny or recount and make a determination on the same.",
            "[9] To answer the question, whether the election before him was conducted substantially in accordance with the Constitution and the relevant electoral law, the Judge came to the conclusion that the irregularities, errors and non-compliance with the law during the collating, counting and tallying of votes fundamentally undermined the electoral process and as such, the result was not accountable, verifiable or accurate.",
            "(b) At the Court of Appeal",
            "[10] Dissatisfied with the Election Court’s decision, the 3rd respondent (the appellant before the Court of Appeal) instituted Nyeri Election Appeal No. 6 of 2018, Martin Nyaga Wambora v. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 2 Others, challenging the Election Court’s decision on 23 grounds summarized as follows; That the learned Judge erred in holding that Muchemi J had jurisdiction to issue substantive Orders of 28th August, 2018 for preservation of electoral materials  and of 31st August, 2018 for provision of security and representation of the 3rd and 4th respondents in the exercise despite not being a gazetted as an a Judge for purposes of that election petition; in issuing Orders for scrutiny without any legal basis; in determining the petition on the basis of unpleaded matters arising from scrutiny and recount and allowing the petitioner to expand the scope of his petition through oral submissions; in failing to refer to the Deputy Registrar’s Report but instead using the ‘handwritten copies of forms allegedly used by the Deputy Registrar during the scrutiny exercise; in misapplying Regulation 81 of the Elections (General) Regulations 2012 in the context of scrutiny and recount; in disregarding empirical evidence before it; in departing from its Orders of 18th January, 2018; in  maintaining the petition despite  the unlawful  interference of the election materials in the execution of the Orders by Muchemi J in the absence of the 3rdrespondent or his agents; in annulling the elections on grounds of irregularities and non-compliance with the law; and for breaching Articles 180 (4), 38, 81, and 86 of the Constitution.",
            "[11] The 1st and 2nd respondent filed a cross appeal on 27th March, 2018 on grounds similar to those in the 3rd respondent’s appeal. They urged the Appellate Court to set aside the Judgment and Decree of the High Court dated 22nd February, 2018, and instead dismiss the petition with costs.",
            "[12] The 4th respondent on the other hand agreed with the 1st, 2nd and 3rdrespondents.",
            "[13] The petitioner herein (the 1st respondent before the Appellate Court) denied interfering with the electoral material and urged that the Orders issued by Muchemi, J were carried out under the supervision and with the participation of IEBC; that he had laid sufficient basis for scrutiny and recount and that the Learned Judge properly exercised his discretion in granting the same; that all the irregularities and illegalities which were unearthed during the scrutiny exercise and detailed in the Deputy Registrar’s report were exhaustively pleaded in the petition; that the irregularities and non-compliance fundamentally affected the results. He urged the Appellate Court to accept the school that postulates the argument that an election Court cannot turn a blind eye on serious electoral malpractices or irregularities exposed by scrutiny or recount.",
            "[14] In its Judgment dated 17th August, 2018, the Appellate Court allowed the appeal and set aside the Judgment by the election Court. The justification for setting aside the said Judgment was premised on four principles elucidated by the Court as;  first, by the provisions of Section 85A of the Elections Act, the Appellate Court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from an election Court on “matters of law” only; second, the nullification test laid down by Section 83 of the Elections Act, makes a rebuttable presumption that the results declared by the electoral body are correct unless the contrary is shown and further that Section 83 is the legal threshold, the fulcrum upon which the decision to nullify an election rests. That this threshold must be measured against the general electoral principles laid down in Articles 81 and 86 of the Constitution; third, a party alleging that there was non-compliance with the Constitution and the law or that that the non-compliance affected the result of the election bears the burden to prove the claim in terms of Sections 107, 108 and 109of the Evidence Act; and finally, a party is bound by its pleadings and cannot be allowed to raise a different or fresh case without due amendment.",
            "[15] The Appellate Court concluded that the trial Judge, had judicially exercised his discretionary powers in the two rulings of 18th and 24th January, 2018 on scrutiny and recount. That from the exercise of re-tally, scrutiny and recount contained in the Deputy Registrar’s Report, it was clear that the 3rdrespondent had more votes than the petitioner. In addition, the Court found that both the petitioner and the learned trial Judge were satisfied with the report by the Deputy Registrar, save for the argument by the petitioner, that totals in the Deputy Registrar’s report were inaccurate, which allegation, even if correct could not have altered the results in the petitioner’s favour.",
            "[16] The Appellate Court held that the learned trial Judge had erred in law by determining matters not pleaded or argued before him. The Appellate Court faulted the learned Judge’s rummage reliance on handwritten notes, in disregard of the report by the Deputy Registrar filed as per its Ruling of 13th February, 2018. Further, the Court held that the petitioner had not discharged the legal burden of proof to the required standard.  The Court found that the grounds, upon which the Learned Judge had based the invalidation of the 3rd respondent’s election, did not meet the established legal standards to warrant such drastic action.",
            " (c) At the Supreme Court",
            " (i) Appeal",
            "[17] Aggrieved by the Appellate Court’s decision, the petitioner filed this appeal seeking the following reliefs: -",
            "(a) That the appeal herein be allowed as prayed.",
            "(b) That the entire Judgment/Orders of the Court of Appeal sitting at Nyeri Election Petition Appeal No.6 of 2018, be set aside, and the Judgment and Decree of the Election Court at Embu, Election Petition No.1 of 2017 delivered on 22nd February, 2018 be reaffirmed;",
            "(c) That the costs of this appeal, and before the Superior Courts be provided for; and ",
            "(d) Any other or further relief that this Court may deem fit to grant.",
            "[18]  The appeal is premised on 12 grounds summarized thus: that the Court of Appeal violated the petitioner’s rights to fair hearing under Article 163 (7), 50(1) and 25(c) of the Constitution by misapplying the decision of this Court in Gatirau Peter Munya v. Dickson Kithinji & 2 Others [2014] eKLR, by misinterpreting its jurisdiction under Section 85A of the Elections Act, by misinterpreting and misapplying the provisions of Section 82 of the Elections Act and by holding that the petitioner had not discharged the burden of proof; that the Court of Appeal rendered a contradictory interpretation and application of Articles 81 and 86 of the Constitution; misinterpreted the provisions of Section 83 of the Elections Act; violated the petitioner’s rights under Articles 38, 81, 86 and 87 by failing to consider material evidence relied on by the election Court; misinterpreted and misapplied the provisions of Articles 38, 81, 86, 87 and 180 of the Constitution by failing to consider the Registrar’s Report; exceeded the scope of its jurisdiction in election petition pursuant to Article 87(1) of the Constitution and Section 85A of the Elections Act; and violated the rights of the petitioner under Articles 27, 47 and 50of the Constitution by setting aside the election Court decision.",
            "[19] The petitioner has itemized 24 issues for determination summarized as follows: -",
            "(i) Whether the Court of Appeal violated the petitioner’s rights to fair hearing under Article 167(3), 50 and 25 (c) of the Constitution;",
            "(ii) Whether the Court of Appeal rendered a contradictory interpretation and application of Article 81 and 86 of the Constitution;",
            "(iii) Whether the Court of Appeal misinterpreted and misapplied the provisions of Section 82 of the Elections Act;",
            "(iv) Whether the Court of Appeal misinterpreted and misapplied the provisions of Section 83 of the Elections Act;",
            "(v) Whether the Court of Appeal exceeded the scope of its jurisdiction pursuant to Section 85A of the Elections Act; ",
            "(vi) Whether the Court of Appeal misinterpreted and misapplied the provisions of Articles 38, 81, 86, 87 and 180 of the Constitution; and ",
            "(vii) Whether the Court of Appeal violated the petitioner’s rights under Articles 38,27, 47, 81, 87",
            "[20] In response to the petition, the 3rd respondent moved the Court vide a Notice of Motion dated 17th September, 2018 for Orders to strike out the appeal for lack of jurisdiction under Article 163 (4) (a) of the Constitution, Sections 15 (1) (2) and Section 17 of the Supreme Court Act. The main basis for the application was that this appeal does not involve the interpretation or application of the Constitution. The 1st and 2nd respondents have also filed their Grounds of Objection dated 26th September, 2018 objecting to the Grounds of Appeal and challenging the jurisdiction of this Court on grounds similar to the 3rd respondent’s Motion.",
            " (ii) The Parties’ Cases",
            "[21] The petitioner filed his submissions dated 9th October, 2018 in opposition to the motion, and submissions dated 1st October, 2018 and further submissions dated 9th November in support of the appeal, the 1st and 2nd respondents filed their joint submissions dated 5th October, 2018, the 3rd respondent filed his submissions in support of the motion dated 1st October, 2018 and submissions on the appeal dated 12th October, 2018 and the 4th respondent filed his submissions dated 15th October, 2018 agreeing in toto and adopting the submissions by the 3rd respondent.",
            " (iii) Application to Strike out for Lack of Jurisdiction",
            "[22] The petitioner contends that the appeal is properly anchored on Article 163(4)(a) of the Constitution and involves the interpretation and application of the Constitution in particular Articles 81(a)(d)(e), 86 and 38 of the Constitution. He argues that the appeal before this Court involves the determination of whether the election for governor Embu County was conducted substantially in accordance with the principles laid down in the Constitution. He cites the case of Hassan Ali Joho & Another v Suleiman Said Shahbal & 2 Others, SC Pet. No. 10 of 2013 in support thereof. He maintains that in interpreting the provisions of the Elections Act, the Election Court and the Court of Appeal could not disengage from the Constitution, as the electoral law is founded on Article 81 and 86 of the Constitution. He also cites the case of Gatirau Peter Munya v. Dickson Mwenda Kithinji & 2 Others, Application No. 5 of 2014 in support of this argument on jurisdiction.",
            "[23] The 1st and 2nd respondents, contend that the appeal does not meet the threshold established under Article 163(4)(a) of the Constitution as it does not involve the interpretation of any Article of the Constitution. It is also submitted that the appeal before the Court of Appeal was purely founded on the provisions of the Elections Act and Elections Rules and that the petitioner has failed to cite a single excerpt from the decision of the Appellate Court, on the interpretation or application of the Constitution. Counsel for the respondents thus invites the Court to down its tools for lack of jurisdiction. He relies inter alia on this Court’s decision in Lawrence Nduttu & 6000 Others v. Kenya Breweries Limited & 3 Others [2017] eKLR (Lawrence Nduttu Case) to support this submission.",
            "[24]  The 3rd respondent agrees with the 1st and 2nd respondents and argues that the grounds before the Appellate Court were premised on the Election Act and the Regulations thereunder but not the Constitution. It is further submitted that the appeal before the Courts below and this Court does not raise any constitutional issues. He cited various decisions of this Court to support this contention.  Furthermore, he insists that the Judgment of the Appellate Court only interrogated the errors committed by the election Court but did not apply or interpret any provisions of the Constitution.",
            "[25]  He argues that not every Judgment by the Court of Appeal is appealable to this Court. He cites the decision of Samuel Kamau Macharia & Another v. KCB & 2 Others, SC. Civil. Appl. No. 2 of 2011 and Lawrence Nduttu Case in that regard.",
            "(iv) Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal",
            "[26] The petitioner submits that the Appellate Court lacks jurisdiction to delve into matters of facts more so in election petition under Section 85A of the Elections Act. That the Court fundamentally erred in law in adjudicating on the veracity and the admissibility of the ‘Handwritten Forms’ for in so doing it invited itself to review the evidence presented before it . He relied on various decisions of both the Court of Appeal and this Court including Gatirau Peter Munya v. Dickson Mwenda Kithinji & 2 Others Petition No. 2B of 2014 [2014] eKLR (Munya 2 Case) to support this argument.",
            "[27] The 1st and 2nd respondents disagree with the submission by the petitioner and instead contend that as per the Appellate Court Judgment, there are no conclusions made in respect of matters of fact. It was further submitted that even if the Appellate Court was to delve into the report by the Deputy Registrar, this would not amount to acting in excess of its jurisdiction as the same was part of its record. Counsel argued that the law does not act in a vacuum and that a Judge can only calibrate the truth of a statement upon inquiry into the records provided. Reliance was placed on the decision in Munya 2 Case (Petition No. 2B of 2014) to explain this principle.",
            "[28] The 3rd respondent whose submissions the 4th respondent has adopted in toto submits that the Appellate Court in its Judgment only explored the Deputy Registrar’s report which formed part of the proceedings. That the Court of Appeal therefore did not err in determining the correct Report that ought to have been relied on by the election Court in view of the conflicting handwritten notes.",
            "(v) Right to Fair Hearing",
            "[29] The petitioner in his submission alleges that there was a violation by the Appellate Court of his right to fair hearing pursuant to Articles 50, 25(c) and 163(7) of the Constitution. It is submitted that this right was violated by virtue of the Court of Appeal’s failure to consider material facts relied on by the election Court. He relied on the persuasive decision of Ruiz Torija v. Spain Application No 18390/91 to apply the principle expounded by the European Court of Human Rights that where a Court fails to consider the submissions or evidence adduced by a party, that failure amounts to violation of the right to fair hearing.",
            "[30] The 1st and 2nd respondents submit that the Court of Appeal was right in upholding the scope of pleadings that had been exceeded by the petitioner and the election Court. That the handwritten notes referred to by the petitioner were introduced through his submissions and could not legally form the basis of annulling an entire election.",
            "[31] The 3rd respondent submits that each and every party was granted an equal opportunity to present their respective cases and the petitioner is wrong in his   assertion that his right to fair hearing was infringed under the Constitution. He relies on the Court of Appeal decision in Judicial Service Commission v. Gladys Boss Shollei [2014] eKLR. It is further argued that the petitioner has failed to state with precision the basis upon which his alleged right to fair hearing was violated.",
            "(vi) Increase of the Scope of Pleadings",
            "[32] The petitioner submits that the Appellate Court erred in finding that the trial Court was wrong in nullifying the elections on unpleaded matters. That all the matters relating to irregularities and illegalities were exhaustively pleaded in the petition in paragraphs 95, 96, 98, 100-104, 108, 109, 110, 111, 114-127. That scrutiny was conducted only to give the trial Court a clear picture as to whether the election was conducted in accordance with the Constitution. It is submitted that the Appellate Court should not have turned a blind eye to issues that arose after scrutiny and recount exercise merely because the issues were not pleaded. The case of Peter Maranga & Another v. Joel Omagwa Onyancha Kisii Pet No 7 of 2013,was cited in support of this argument.",
            "[33] To the contrary, the 1st and 2nd respondents submit that it is trite law that a party is bound by its pleadings and that the Appellate Court was right in disregarding unpleaded issues in its Judgment. The 3rd respondent agrees with the other two respondents and submits that the election Court had no jurisdiction to consider issues that had not been pleaded. He relies on the decision in Jones v. National Coal Board [1972] 2 QB 55 and this Court’s decision in Zachariah Okoth Obado v. Edward Akong’o Oyugi & 2 Others [2014] eKLR.",
            "[34] It is further submitted that the petitioner cannot therefore depart from the parameters laid down in his case, as to do so, would deny the respondents an opportunity to reply.",
            "(vii) Scrutiny and Recount",
            "[35] The petitioner submits that a scrutiny report is binding on a trial Court as held in Moses Masika Wetangula v. Musikari Kombo & 2 Others Civil Appeal No. 43 of 2013 and James Omingo Magara v. Manson Onyongo Nyamweya & 2 Others Civil Appeal No. 8 of 2010 [2010] eKLR.  He submits further that from the scrutiny report, it was apparent that the election could not be ascertained, and as such, the same could not have been free and fair.",
            "[36] The 1st and 2nd respondent submit that contrary to the petitioner’s assertions, the Court of Appeal duly considered the Scrutiny Report by the Deputy Registrar at page 33 of its Judgment. It was submitted that the respondents only took issue with the trial Court’s decision to rely on the handwritten report in disregard of the Deputy Registrar’s Report duly filed in Court. The respondents appreciate the place of scrutiny in election disputes but fault the trial Court’s reliance on material that was not part of the official Report.",
            "(viii) Applicability of Section 83 of the Elections Act",
            "[37] The petitioner submits that this Court expounded on the meaning of Section 83 of the Elections Act in Presidential Petition No. 1 of 2017 Raila Amollo Odinga v. IEBC (Raila 2017) at paragraph 208 to mean that the election must be conducted substantially in accordance with the principles of the Constitution and the Elections Act. He submitted further that having pointed out the irregularities and illegalities that emerged from the scrutiny report, there were clear breaches of Articles 81 and 86 of the Constitution which require the elections to be accurate, verifiable, accountable, and transparent, it was impossible to ascertain the election result for the gubernatorial elections for Embu.  He urged the Court to apply a purposive approach to the interpretation of Section 83 of the Elections Act as per the decision in Raila 2017 to declare that the gubernatorial Election in Embu County was not conducted in compliance with the Constitutional principles under Articles 81, 86 and the Electoral Laws.",
            "[38] The 1st and 2nd respondents submit that the election was conducted substantially in compliance with the Constitution and electoral laws. To support this contention, it was submitted that the petitioner before the election Court admitted that the voting exercise was conducted without a hitch and further that the Deputy Registrar’s finding after the Scrutiny exercise conducted in the presence of all the representatives, confirmed the win by the 3rd respondent.",
            "[39] The 3rd respondent submits that the threshold for nullifying an election set under Section 83 of the Election Act requires the non-compliance to substantially affect the result of the election.  He submitted further, that to determine the effect in an election, the quantitative test is the most relevant where numbers and figures are in question while the qualitative test becomes relevant where the quality of the entire election is in question. Reliance was placed on the decision in Munya 2. According to Counsel, the election was conducted in accordance with the Constitution and the law more so as the quantitative test of the election was applied and confirmed.",
            "[40] It is submitted that the Appellate Court Judgment was therefore legally sound, having concluded that the election was substantially conducted in accordance with the Constitution and the Electoral law. The Court was satisfied that the irregularities and other acts of non-compliance were not of such a nature as to have affected the results in tandem with the holding of this Court in. Munya 2 and Lord Denning’s pronouncement in Morgan v. Simpson [1974] 3 ALL ER 722.",
            "C. ANALYSIS",
            " [41] Having carefully considered the pleadings of the parties, the attendant interlocutory motions, the list of authorities provided by counsel for the parties, and the robust oral and written submissions of counsel, we have come to the conclusion, that there are only two issues, whose determination would be dispositive of this appeal. Towards this end, the issues for determination are:",
            "(i) Whether this Court has jurisdiction to determine the Petition of Appeal;",
            "(ii) Whether the Court of Appeal acted in excess of jurisdiction in determining the appeal before it.",
            " (i) On Jurisdiction",
            "[42]  The gist of the respondents’ Preliminary Objection, is that this Court lacks the jurisdiction to entertain the Petition of Appeal, as the same does not meet the threshold of an appeal envisaged in Article 163 (4) (a) of the Constitution. Counsel for the 3rd respondent, Mr Ahmednassir, was categorical that the Memorandum of Appeal at the Appellate Court, the issues for determination as formulated by that Court, and the ensuing Judgment there-from, did not involve any interpretation or application of the Constitution so as to justify a further appeal to this Court. The elaborate written and oral submissions by Counsel, including those in support, are set out in detail in the foregoing paragraphs.",
            "[43]  On the other hand, in opposition to the Preliminary Objection, the petitioner maintains that this Court has the requisite jurisdiction to determine his Appeal as the same falls squarely within the ambit of Article 163 (4) (a) of the Constitution. Both counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Ngatia and Professor Ojienda argue that the Appeal involves the interpretation and application of Articles 25 (c), 38, 47, 50, 81, 86, 87, 88, and 180 of the Constitution. It is their argument that the election of Governor of Embu County was so badly conducted that it failed to meet the constitutional and legal requirements of a free and fair election and that the irregularities affected the results. Professor Ojienda maintains that the Memorandum of Appeal at the Appellate Court was anchored on constitutional grounds to wit, grounds 19 and 20. Again, the elaborate written and oral submissions by counsel are set out in the foregoing paragraphs.",
            "[44] The operative provision of the Constitution is Article 163(4) (a) of the Constitution, which provides, that an appeal lies from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court “as of right in any case involving the interpretation or application of the Constitution”. This Court has already determined the import, scope, and limits of its appellate jurisdiction under Article 163 (4) (a) of the Constitution in Samuel Kamau Macharia and Another v. Kenya Commercial Bank and 2 Others, [2012] eKLR; Lawrence Nduttu & 6000 Others v. Kenya Breweries Ltd & Another [2012] eKLR; Peter Oduor Ngoge v. Francis Ole Kaparo & 5 Others [2012] eKLR; Gatirau Peter Munya v. Dickson Mwenda Kithinji & 2 Others [2014] eKLR; Evans Odhiambo Kidero & 4 Others v. Ferdinand Ndung’u Waititu & 4 Others [2014] eKLR; Hassan Ali Joho & Another v. Suleiman Said Shahbal & 2 Others [2013] eKLR among others.",
            "[45]  The jurisprudence of the Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction is (or ought to be) well settled given the Court’s repeated authoritative pronouncements in this regard. However, the question as to whether an appeal lies to the Court under Article 163 (4) (a) of the Constitution still claims prominence at the Court’s docket of Preliminaries. Nowhere is this more pronounced than in appeals from decisions of the Court of Appeal in election petitions. From the authorities cited above, there ought to be no longer any lingering doubt about certain jurisdictional truisms such as:",
            "1. That not all appeals lie from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court.",
            "2. That for an appeal to lie to the Supreme Court from the Court of Appeal, it must be preferred under either Article 163 (4) (a) or 163 (4) (b) of the Constitution.",
            "3. That there is no automatic right of appeal from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court; and therefore an intending appellant must still satisfy the Court that an appeal indeed meets the threshold of either of the two limbs as already illuminated in the decisions of the Court.",
            "4. That for an appeal to lie to the Supreme Court under Article 163 (4) (a), the said appeal must, have originated from the Court of Appeal, where the issues of contestation revolved around the interpretation and application of the Constitution. Consequently, the appellant must be challenging the interpretation or application of the Constitution that the Appellate Court used to dispose of the matter at that forum.",
            "5. That general references to provisions of the Constitution by a superior court in the course of its judgment do not, without more, bring the resultant appeal therefrom, within the ambit of Article 163 (4) (a), unless it can be demonstrated that, the said court, in arriving at the conclusions it did, had taken a trajectory of constitutional interpretation or application.",
            "6. That at issue in an appeal under Article 163 (4) (a), must be, a cogent question of constitutional controversy, resulting from the manner in which the Court of Appeal interpreted, or applied the Constitution.",
            "7. That a Memorandum of Appeal, wherein constitutional issues, that were not at play at the Appellate Court, are being raised for the first time, does not suffice to clothe the Supreme Court with jurisdiction under Article 163 (4) (a).",
            "[46]  These principles are self-evident from the precedents cited, and should suffice, as a guide, to litigants who seek to invoke the Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction. It should also be quite clear, that the principles, are applicable in equal measure, to electoral disputes that may have escalated to the Court of Appeal, as was stated by this Court in Evans Odhiambo Kidero v. Ferdinand Waititu. It would however appear from the submissions of Counsel for the Petitioner herein, that this Court may have established, some kind of exception, regarding election petitions, in so far as the scope of Article 163 (4) (a) is concerned.",
            "[47]  In Fredrick Otieno Outa v. Jared Odoyo Okello & 4 Others SC Petition No. 10 of 2014; [2014] eKLR, this Court observed:",
            "“In adopting this view, we would observe that the Elections Act, 2011 enacts in substantive form the constitutional principle of securing for the Kenyan people a representative democracy, in which the mandate of leadership is attained through popular elective politics, based on the ideals of free and fair election. The realization of this goal is partly attainable through universal franchise, expressed in a voting exercise guided by appropriate legislation, that is derived from the premises and values embodied in Articles 38, 81 and 86 of the Constitution. Thus it is for certain that electoral contestations will involve constitutional interpretation or application”.",
            "[48]  In Evans Odhiambo Kidero & 4 Others v. Ferdinand Ndung’u Waititu & 4 Others; this Court held: [Para. 144]",
            "“It follows that Article 163 (4) (a) of the Constitution confers upon the Supreme Court a role of constitutional interpretation and application, which cannot be performed through a bare apportionment of judicial tasks,...Where disputes arise with regard to the interpretation and application of such principles and norms in election petitions, this Court, being Kenya’s apex Court, cannot gaze helplessly when moved by a litigant.”",
            "[49] In Gatirau Peter Munya v. Dickson Kithinji & 2 Others; Civil Application No.5 of 2014 commonly referred to as (Munya 1), this Court made the following observation in response to an argument by Counsel for the 1st respondent therein:",
            "“We hasten to add that the Elections Act, and the Regulations thereunder, are normative derivatives of the principles embodied in Article 81 and 86 of the Constitution, and that in interpreting them, a Court of law cannot disengage from the Constitution.” [Emphasis added]. ",
            "[50] These pronouncements by the Supreme Court are not only jurisprudentially sound, but conceptually logical, as they aptly capture the architecture of the 2010 Constitution. However, the Munya, Outa and Kidero decisions should not be taken to mean, that somehow, they give a Carte Blanche for admitting appeals, from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court in election petitions. Indeed in its Ruling in Munya 1 this Court, in agreement with counsel for the 1st respondent therein, reaffirmed its holding in earlier decisions regarding its jurisdiction and firmly stated that “not every election petition decision is appealable to the Supreme Court under Article 163 (4) (a) of the Constitution.”  The Court was alive to the fact that, what it had to decide, was whether the appeal before it, had arisen from a decision of the Appellate Court, in which issues of interpretation and application of the Constitution were at play. The Court had to determine, whether the applicant was faulting the interpretation or application of the Constitution in reaching the decision to set aside the Judgment of the High Court.",
            "[51]  The Munya Case was the first one, in which both the High Court and Court of Appeal had to grapple with the meaning, scope, and applicability of Articles 81 and 86 of the Constitution as they tested the integrity of that particular election. What meaning for example had to be assigned to the Constitutional edict in Article 81 that an election had to be “accurate?” The Supreme Court bench concluded, that the issue of the applicability of Articles 81 and 86 of the Constitution, in so far as determining the accuracy and verifiability of that particular election was alive, throughout the proceedings in the two Superior Courts. As the parties had taken opposite views on how the two courts had navigated this fundamental question, the Supreme Court decided, that it had to weigh in under Article 163 (4) (a) of the Constitution.",
            "[52]  It was long after this conclusion that the Court responded to Mr. Muthomi, counsel for the first respondent in the Munya Case. Counsel had argued that what was being impugned by the applicant in that case, was the Appellate Court’s interpretation of Section 87 of the Election Act, and this, had nothing to do with the interpretation or application of the Constitution. (See para. 75). At paragraph 77 of that Ruling, the learned Judges of the Supreme Court (Ojwang & Wanjala), rendered themselves thus:",
            "“While we agree with Mr. Muthomi, regarding his contention that Section 87 of the Elections Act cannot be equated to a constitutional provision, we must hasten to add that the Elections Act, and the Regulations thereunder, are normative derivatives of the principles embodied in Articles 81 and 86 of the Constitution, and that in interpreting them, a Court of law cannot disengage from the Constitution.” ",
            "[53]  It is this pronouncement that is increasingly being taken out of context, to justify the perception that all appeals from decisions of the Court of Appeal in election petitions lie to the Supreme Court!",
            "[54]  This then brings us to the submissions by counsel for the parties on the issue of jurisdiction. It is Mr. Ahmednassir’s argument that the Petition of Appeal does not meet the threshold for admission in Article 163 (4) (a) of the Constitution. Counsel submits that there was not a single issue revolving around the interpretation and application of the Constitution at the Appellate Court. According to counsel, constitutional issues are being raised for the first time in the Memorandum of Appeal to this Court. Even the body of the Judgment of the Court of Appeal does not reveal that there was any cogent question of constitutional controversy that the Court addressed and which can support a further appeal to this Court.  Neither can it be said, that in arriving at its decision, the Court of Appeal took a trajectory of constitutional interpretation or application. This view is supported by Mr. Kibicho, Counsel for the 1st and 2nd respondents.",
            "[55]  Professor Ojienda on the other hand takes the view that the Petition of Appeal is properly before this Court as it is grounded on grievances as to how the Court of Appeal interpreted and applied the provisions of the Constitution.  Specifically, Counsel submits that the Learned Judges of Appeal erred in law and fact, as they interpreted and applied Articles 81 (a), (d), (e), 86 and 38 of the Constitution, when they held that the massive irregularities that were observed during the scrutiny and recount exercise amounted to mere administrative errors and were not sufficient to vitiate an election. Counsel further argues that the Memorandum of Appeal filed by the 3rd respondent herein at the Court of Appeal itself raised constitutional grievances to the extent that it faulted the trial Court for diminishing the spirit of Article 38 of the Constitution. Professor Ojienda submits that what the petitioner is seeking, is for the Supreme Court to interpret the provisions of Articles 25 (c), 50 (1), 81 (e), 86, 87(1), 94 (1) and 163 (7) of the Constitution of Kenya. In support of this pursuit, Counsel cites the case of Gatirau Peter Munya v. Dickson Mwenda Kithinji which in his view held that: “The Elections Act, and the Regulations thereunder, are normative derivatives of the Principles embodied in Articles 81 and 86 of the Constitution, and that in interpreting them, a Court of law cannot disengage from the Constitution.”",
            "[56]  Applying the principles that have been established by this Court to determine whether or not an appeal lies to this Court, we find that on the whole, the Petition of Appeal before us, does not meet the threshold to be admitted under Article 163(4) (a) of the Constitution, save in one instance to which we shall turn later. Our examination of the proceedings at the trial Court and Court of Appeal has not established that the determination of the petition turned on the interpretation and application of the Constitution. In this regard, we agree with Mr. Ahmednassir, Counsel for the 3rd respondent, to the effect that what the petitioner is doing is to introduce constitutional questions in his Memorandum of Appeal, that none of the two Superior Courts dealt with in arriving at their decisions. We are being invited to interpret provisions of the Constitution in a vacuum, a task for which this Court could hardly have been established. There must be a real controversy relating to how the Appellate Court interpreted and applied the Constitution to trigger the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction under Article 163 (4) (a).",
            "[57]  Professor Ojienda particularly zeroed in on the Court of Appeal’s Judgment at page 22, to make the case that indeed, the Appellate Court had generated a controversy worthy of this Court’s attention by the way the former had interpreted and/or applied the Constitution. The Court of Appeal stated:",
            "“Section 83 is the legal threshold; the fulcrum upon which the decision to nullify an election rests. That threshold must be measured against the general electoral principles laid down in Articles 81 and 86 of the Constitution, that, inter alia, elections must be free and fair, conducted by secret ballot; free from violence, intimidation, improper influence or corruption, transparent and administered in an impartial, neutral, efficient, accurate and accountable manner; that whatever voting method is used, the system must be simple, accurate, verifiable, secure, accountable and transparent; that the votes cast are counted, tabulated and the results announced promptly by the presiding officer at each polling station; that the from polling stations are openly and accurately collated and promptly announced by the returning officer; and that there be in place appropriate structures and mechanisms to eliminate electoral malpractice, including the safekeeping of election materials.”",
            "[58]  We are at pains to understand how the statement by the Court of Appeal as quoted above, can be the basis for invoking the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 163 (4) (a) of the Constitution. What interpretative exercise, can the Appellate Court be said to have been engaged in by stating what it did? Wasn’t the Court simply reciting what can be called the “Constitutional Creed for Free and Fair Elections”? Wasn’t the Court simply reproducing verbatim the provisions of Articles 81 and 86 of the Constitution?; Wasn’t the Court doing what this Court said a Court of law must do in Munya 1?",
            "[59]  We hereby re-emphasize that the oft-quoted pronouncement by this Court in Munya 1 was neither a “holding” nor was it meant to be a Carte Blanche for invoking this Court’s jurisdiction under Article 163 (4) (a) of the Constitution in electoral disputes.",
            "[60]  Be that as it may, we note that the most strenuously contested issue in this petition right from the High Court through the Court of Appeal and now the Supreme Court was how the trial Judge “applied the test of verifiability” by his deployment of the Recount/Scrutiny Report. In our view, this particular controversy goes to the essence of how a Court of law should apply the verifiability test under Article 86 of the Constitution. This is an issue of application of the Constitution, and it is in this respect alone, that we hereby assume jurisdiction so that we may address with finality some of the questions that have arisen regarding the Recount and Scrutiny Report. These questions are as follows?",
            "1. Under what circumstances may an election Court make an Order for a recount and/ or scrutiny?",
            "2. When may an Election Court issue an Order for a recount or scrutiny suo motu?",
            "3. Can an election Court draw conclusions and make adverse findings arising from the results of a scrutiny even if those findings are not based on the petitioner’s pleadings?",
            "4. What weight ought an election Court place on the submissions of the parties on the contents of a recount/scrutiny report?",
            "5. What is the scope of a recount/scrutiny report?",
            " (ii) When to Make an Order for Scrutiny or Recount",
            "[61]  This issue has been addressed variously in the Superior Courts. In Gatirau Peter Munya v. Dickson Mwenda Kithinji [2014] eKLR, this Court extensively reviewed the law (both statutory and case law) relating to scrutiny and recount. The Court proceeded to lay down a number of guiding principles at paragraph 153 of its Judgment. We reiterate that these principles remain valid and should ideally inform the Superior Courts when faced with the question. Let us restate that an order for scrutiny or re-count may be made following a request by any of the parties, at any stage, after the filing of a petition, before the determination of the petition. However, the party applying for an Order of scrutiny, must establish a basis for such a request by way of pleadings, affidavits, or evidence adduced during the trial. The trial Court, in issuing an Order for scrutiny or recount should ideally confine itself to the specifics of the application.",
            " (iii) Issuing an Order Suo Motu",
            "[62]  A trial Court may issue an Order for scrutiny or recount suo motu, if it considers that such an Order, may aid it in arriving at a just and fair determination of the petition. However, this discretion must be exercised sparingly, and should be informed by the pleadings or evidence. The trial Court should record the reasons for such an Order, always bearing in mind that, at the end of the day, the case belongs to the petitioner.",
            " (iv) Findings not Based on Pleadings",
            "[63]  A scrutiny or recount exercise, is to be triggered by an application by any of the parties to the dispute. If made suo motu, it should still be informed by the pleadings and evidence adduced during the hearing. The scrutiny or recount exercise is not meant to be a fishing expedition to aid the petitioner. It is intended to aid the Court in verifying and establishing the validity of the vote. It follows that the trial Court ought to confine itself to the claims that necessitated the scrutiny or recount in the first place. Were the Court to have the liberty of making conclusions from the scrutiny report, that are not based on the pleadings, this would open a pandora’s box whereby courts of law, would be turned into automatic sounding boards for election losers. It is worthy repeating the age-old maxim that parties are bound by their pleadings. The slightly different approach that this Court took in Abdirahman Ibrahim Mohamud v. Mohamed Ahmed Kolosh & 2 Others Petition No. 26 of 2018; can be explained by the fact that in that case, an application for scrutiny and recount had been made in relation to specific polling stations. During the scrutiny exercise, a number of serious irregularities (though not pleaded) were unearthed in those very same polling stations. Although the irregularities were not part of the pleadings, the election Court could not close its eyes to their effect on the election. An application for scrutiny had been made in respect of particular polling stations, and since the irregularities in question, were unearthed in those same polling stations, the petitioner could not be said to have been engaged in a fishing exercise.",
            " (v) Submissions on the Scrutiny Report",
            "[64]  Parties are entitled to make submissions on the content of the scrutiny or recount report. The submissions are intended to solidify or controvert the claims on which the scrutiny or recount exercise was based. The submissions are not meant to introduce new evidence that goes beyond the scope of the petition. The trial Court should consider those submissions just as any others made during the hearing.",
            "(vi) The Scope of a Scrutiny or Recount Report",
            "[65]  A scrutiny or recount report is that which is prepared by the Registrar, signed by all the parties, and formally tabled before Court. The report should confine itself to the claims on which the Order for scrutiny was based, or the specific directions given by the trial Court, when issuing the Order for scrutiny suo motu. Any document that is not so prepared and signed ought not to be considered as part of the Scrutiny Report. The Scrutiny Report forms part of the proceedings of the Court.",
            " (vii) The Hand Written Notes",
            "[66]  We now turn to the question as to whether the Court of Appeal rightly faulted the trial Judge for relying on what came to be known as the “hand-written notes of the Deputy Registrar”. It is to be noted that the trial Judge nullified the election of the 3rd respondent herein almost solely, on the basis of the contents of the said hand-written notes. In our view, based on the law, purpose and process of scrutiny, we have no hesitation in agreeing with the Court of Appeal in faulting the Learned trial Judge’s reliance on the Deputy Registrar’s hand written notes. Clearly these notes were not part of what was formally tabled before the Court. The contents of the hand written notes clearly introduced matters that could not have been responded to by the respondents as they were not part of the pleadings. It is also obvious that the hand written notes were not part of the Scrutiny and Recount Report properly so understood.",
            " (viii) Whether the Court of Appeal Acted in Excess of its Jurisdiction",
            "[67]  It is the petitioner’s case that the Court of Appeal acted in excess of its jurisdiction by delving into matters of fact contrary to provisions of Section 85A of the Elections Act. Counsel for the petitioner submits that it was a fundamental error of law for the Court of Appeal to adjudicate on the veracity and admissibility of the “hand-written notes” and evaluate their effect which clearly invited them to review the evidence presented before the trial court. This Court has already addressed the question as to the meaning of “matters of law” as opposed to matters of fact in Gatirau Peter Munya v. Dickson Mwenda Kithinji.",
            "[68]  It is our perception, that what was before the Court of Appeal, was not necessarily the veracity of the contents of the handwritten notes by the Deputy Registrar, but whether, the said notes could be considered as forming part of the Scrutiny Report. Such a question in our view, was clearly not one of fact but of law. Secondly, the Court of Appeal had to interrogate the contents of the handwritten notes to determine their admissibility. As parties are bound by their pleadings, it was quite in order for the Appellate Court to determine whether, the contents of the hand written notes, derived from the pleadings. Such an inquiry was not meant to question the Learned Judge’s findings of fact, but to determine whether the evidence on which he relied was admissible or not. This question, was a matter of law and properly within the Appellate Court’s jurisdiction. We therefore find that the Court of Appeal did not act in excess of its jurisdiction.",
            " (ix) Verifiability under Article 86 of the Constitution",
            "[69]  The petitioner contends that the election result could not be ascertained, as the results declared, were different from those revealed by the Scrutiny and Recount Report. This variance in the totals, according to the petitioner, means that the election was not verifiable. He urges the Court to adopt a purposive interpretation of Section 83 of the Elections Act. It is important to recall that this Section states:",
            "“No election shall be declared void by reason of non-compliance with any written law relating to that election if it appears that the election was conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the constitution and in that written law or that non-compliance did not affect the result of the election.”",
            "[70]  In Raila Amolo Odinga & Another v. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 2 Others; Presidential Election Petition No. 1 of 2017 [2017] eKLR, this Court held that in interpreting this Section, a disjunctive test had to be applied with the effect that a party must demonstrate that the election was either not conducted in compliance with the Constitution and the electoral law or, that the non-compliance affected the results of the election.” We see no reason to depart from this test in the matter before us. While we are not in a position to actually determine which of the total figures actually represents the final tally in the Embu Gubernatorial Election, (a matter of fact dealt with by the Election Court), we note that all the three different figures indicated a victory for the 3rd respondent. The issue would have been different, in terms of verifiability, had the post-declaration totals indicated a victory for the petitioner. As it is, the variance in the totals (all signaling the 3rd respondent as the winner), cannot suffice to vitiate the election. Can it be argued for example, that given these different totals, which nonetheless hand victory to the same person, it is not possible to tell who won the election? We don’t think so.",
            " (x) Reliance on Hand-Written Notes",
            "[71]  Regarding the reliance on hand-written notes by the trial Judge to nullify the election, based solely on the contents of those notes, we agree with the Court of Appeal’s finding that the Learned Judge had erred in that regard. The Scrutiny Report prepared and tabled in court by the Deputy Registrar plus the evidence tendered at the trial, ought to have provided the basis for any conclusions arrived at by the Judge. To base the nullification of an election on a document, that is alien to the parties, or at least some of the parties to the dispute, is to deny the latter, a fair hearing. The hand-written notes were not part of the typed Scrutiny Report that was tabled and submitted upon in Court before judgment. The notes were referred to by the trial Judge, after the parties had closed their submissions. The parties had clearly lost the opportunity to make an impression on the Court regarding this document upon which, the decision to nullify the election would depend.",
            "[72]  Taking all the conclusions and findings we have arrived at, we see no basis upon which to interfere with the Appellate Court’s decision. It follows that this appeal must be dismissed.",
            "D. COSTS ",
            "[73]  It is a settled principle of law that costs follow the event. This Court adheres to this principle in a majority of cases. However, the Court may and does exercise discretion to apportion costs if circumstances of a particular case so require. In this particular case, on the basis of our decision, it is not in doubt that the 3rd Respondent herein, can no longer be condemned in costs at the High Court. Such costs are to be borne by the Petitioner on the basis of the Capping as required by law. The situation changes at the appellate level, considering the fact that all the three key parties have contributed to the further development of electoral jurisprudence, and none ought to be faulted for this noble pursuit.",
            "E. ORDERS",
            "(i) The Petition of Appeal dated 7th September, 2018 is hereby dismissed.",
            "(ii) The Judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 17th August, 2018 is hereby upheld.",
            "(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, the declaration of the result of the election by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission in respect of the Governor for Embu County is hereby upheld.",
            "(iv) At the High Court, costs shall be borne as follows: the Petitioner herein shall bear his own costs and those of the 3rd Respondent herein. The 1st Respondent [IEBC] shall bear its own costs. At the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, Each Party shall bear its own costs.",

            "JUDGMENT OF THE COURT",
            "The August 8th 2017 election outcome for the Governor, Embu County was indeed a close contest with the votes almost evenly divided between Martin Nyaga Wambora, the appellant, and Lenny Maxwell Kivuti, the 1st respondent. In situations like that, each party will claim victory and try to bring all forms of evidence to prove that victor; and that is perfectly understandable.",
            "When the voting closed, the 2nd respondent declared the following results for the gubernatorial election;",
            "(a) Cyrus Njiru – 2,352",
            "(b) Kiragu Kithinji – 50,440",
            "(c) Lenny Maxwell Kivuti - 96,775",
            "(d) Leonard Muriuki Njeru – 2,022",
            "(e) Martin Nyaga Wambora – 97,760",
            "(f) Peter Njagi Njuki – 981,",
            "and declared the appellant with 97,760 votes as the duly elected Governor with the 1st respondent, as the runner-up with 96,775, the difference between them being 985 votes. The latter was, however, aggrieved by this outcome and claimed in his petition before the election court that, although the process of casting of ballots in respect of that election was smooth and peaceful, the counting and tallying process was characterized by grave irregularities; that the results were inflated and swapped in favour of the appellant; that Forms 37A were tampered with at the tallying centres to reflect fictitious figures; that some Forms 37A were not signed by agents; that his agents were barred from participating in the counting and tallying of ballots at the polling stations; and that the counting of the votes was undertaken in a manner that contravened Article 81 of the Constitution, section 38A of the Elections Act and Regulation 69(2) of the Election (General) Regulations 2012.",
            "In the end, the 1st respondent applied for a re-tally of the votes cast in two polling stations within Mbeere South Constituency, scrutiny and recount of all the votes cast within Manyatta and Runyenjes Constituencies, nullification of the results declared, and a declaration that he was the validly elected Governor of Embu County.",
            "Responding to the 1st respondent, the appellant, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th respondents denied all the allegations by the 1st respondent and asserted instead, that the gubernatorial election was conducted in accordance with the Constitution and the law; that it was free, fair and transparent; and that the appellant and the 4th respondent were validly declared the Governor and Deputy Governor, respectively.",
            "Taking the witness stand, the 1st respondent insisted that he won the gubernatorial elections; that the votes announced by the 2nd respondent exceeded the number of registered voters by far. He gave the example of Runyenjes Constituency and said that the total votes announced were 129,652 while the registered voters were only 86, 977, exceeding the number of registered voters by 42, 675. In Manyatta Constituency, the total votes cast were 105,700, yet the registered voters were only 99,339, a difference of 6,361 votes. It was also claimed that there were discrepancies in Forms 37A and 37B, in respect of what was announced and what was recorded at the polling stations. The 1st respondent testified of how he witnessed the presiding officers altering Forms 37A at Kangaru School; that the total votes cast for the Governor exceeded those cast for the Woman Representative and for the Senator; and that many Forms 37A were not stamped.",
            "He was optimistic that, if the court allowed scrutiny and a recount of the votes, he would win with 97,286 votes against the appellant’s 96,717; that it was only through scrutiny that the state of the electoral materials and the actual total votes would be established.",
            "Regarding his agents, the 1st respondent testified that they were intimidated and subjected to discrimination, by being denied copies of Forms 37A and an opportunity to sign them, while agents of the appellant were allowed to access and to sign. His efforts to bring these matters to the attention of the returning officer for Manyatta Constituency bore no fruits as the said returning officer dismissed him. He also stated that some of the forms were signed by strangers who purported to be his agents.",
            "He alleged that results were manipulated in Karau Primary School, Embu Urban Primary School, Munyori Primary School polling stations, among others; that he lost and the appellant gained votes in Githunguriri Tea Buying Centre polling station, Embu County Primary School, Embu County Primary School Stream 1, Gategi Primary School, Karau Primary School, Embu Municipal Stadium, St. Andrews Primary School, Mikimbi Full Gospel Church polling stations; that the effect of the errors in Forms 37A and 37B was that his votes increased by 817 and those of the appellant reduce by 615 votes, narrowing the margin between them to 168 votes; that if the votes recorded by his agents were taken into account in Forms 37A he would have been ahead of the appellant by 569 votes; that in the following polling stations Forms 37A were altered; Embu County Primary School, Kirimari Boys Secondary School, Minai Coffee Factory, Muvandori Primary School, Ndatu Catholic Church grounds, Gichago Coffee Factory, Gikirima Coffee Factory, Kathugu Primary School, and St Michael’s Primary School.",
            "Kenrodgers Munene Njiru, Justa Wawira Mwaniki and Catherine Nyaga, agents of the 1st respondent, were unanimous in their testimony that the voting and counting went on well and that at the end of counting, save for Catherine Nyaga, they signed Forms 37A for their respective polling stations, confirming that the results were indeed correct. Although Selesia Muthua, the 1st respondent’s agent at at Karau Primary School did not sign Form 37A, he was satisfied with the voting. He noted however that 512 persons voted for the other five seats, but only 504 voted for Governor in his polling station.",
            "At Mwenendega Primary School polling station stream 1, Joseph Njiru Munene noted that the appellant had 3 votes more in Form 37A than what had been announced; and that, according to his notebook 444 people voted, yet Form 37A indicated that number to be 455. Purity Mumbi Guthiga was the 1st respondent’s agent at Kagaari primary School polling station stream 2. According to her the results in the form she signed tallied with the notes she took at the declaration of results, but the one filed in court had different results, where the petitioner’s votes were reduced by 9. For his part, Robert Njue Kirembui who oversaw voting at Kianjokoma Primary School polling centre, the results reflected in the form tallied with his notes save for the fact that votes recorded in the form in favour of the 3rd respondent reflected 336 votes while in fact he got 186 votes “or thereabouts”.",
            "Before us, senior learned counsel for the 1st respondent submitted, in addition to the foregoing that the appeal was incompetent and the Court has no jurisdiction to entertain it for the notice of appeal was filed in the wrong court; that the notice of appeal was initially filed in the High Court registry on 22nd February, 2018 instead of this Court’s registry. It is conceded, however that the same notice was filed in or transmitted to our registry on 28th February, 2018, well within time. Because the answer to this issue is straight forward, we dispose of it right away by stating that in Sammy Ndungu Waity V IEBC & 3 Others, Election Petition Appeal No. 2 of 2018 this Court clarified that under Rule 6 of the Court’s Election Petition Rules, the notice of appeal must be filed in this Court. In this appeal, the notice of appeal, though initially filed in the High Court, it was shortly thereafter also filed in or transmitted to the Court of Appeal registry within the time set for the filing of a notice of appeal. For that reason, we are of the view that nothing really turns on that complaint. See also Owino Paul Ongili Babu V Francis Wambugu Mureithi & 2 Others, Election Petition Appeal No. 18 of 2018.",
            "The combined effect of the 2nd to the 4th respondents’ case was that, like the 1st respondent and his witnesses, polling was free of violence, intimidation or voter bribery. They denied that the results in the forms were altered and maintained that there was no evidence that the total votes cast exceeded the total registered votes for Manyatta and Runyenjes Constituencies. They insisted that as against the registered voters, less people voted.",
            "They maintained that errors, if any, in the transposition of results from Forms 37A to Forms 37B, were minimal, clerical and could not affect the results declared; that if there was a variance in the results between those of Governor and Woman Representative, they could not be to the extent alleged by the 1st respondent; and that in any case the variance could be explained; that the minor errors noted might have been occasioned by fatigue on the part of the election officials.",
            "The only errors conceded were detected in Runyenjes Constituency, Ugweri polling station where the appellant benefited from 8 votes which he did not deserve. At Gategi Primary School polling station stream 1, in Mbeere South constituency, the appellant was awarded an extra 400 votes in error. But his scores in Marimari Primary School polling station were, mistakenly not recorded. The 1st respondent’s votes at Munyori Primary School polling station were understated by 32 votes while in Kamutwanjiru Primary School polling centre, his votes were overstated by 9 votes. These anomalies, the 2nd to 4th respondents maintained, were not enough to alter the overall results.",
            "At the end of the oral hearing, the petitioner filed an application for scrutiny and recount of the ballots in several specified polling stations in three of the four constituencies in Embu County, Mbeere South, Manyatta and Runyenjes constituencies. The Judge, in granting the request for re-tallying of forms 37A, 37B and 37C in respect of specific polling stations, directed that the exercise be undertaken by the Deputy Registrar. Upon concluding the exercise the Deputy Registrar filed a report as directed.",
            "Upon considering the report and the entire evidence presented before him, the learned Judge noted that, on the basis of Forms 37A, the appellant was ahead of the 1st respondent as follows;",
            "Martin Nyaga Wambora  - 97,659",
            "Lenny Maxwell Kivuti   -      97,141, a difference of 518 votes,",
            "On the other hand the totals from the recount and re-tally of Forms 37B and 37C were-",
            "Martin Nyaga Wambora  - 97,662",
            "Lenny Maxwell Kivuti   - 97,109, constituting a difference of 553 votes.",
            "In either scenario, the learned Judge concluded on this point that the appellant was still ahead of the 1st respondent. He stressed that the purpose of scrutiny, re-tallying and recount was to ascertain the number of votes garnered by each of the candidates; and that from that exercise, the duly elected candidate was the appellant.",
            "Citing the decisions in Charles C. Sande V. Kenya Co-operative Creameries Limited, LLR 314 (CA) Nairobi City Council V. Thabiti Enterprises Ltd (1995-98) (EA) 231 and David Sironga ole Tukai V. Francis arap Muge & 2 Others [2014] eKLR, the learned Judge warned himself of the need to confine his consideration of the petition to the pleadings and evidence before him. Guided by the above authorities, the Judge agreed with the submission that the issue of counterfoils not being sealed in the ballot box was not pleaded in the petition; that the appellant did not have opportunity to address it during the trial; and that raising it at that stage amounted to an ambush.",
            "Having made what we consider to be the correct decision, the learned Judge proceeded to distinguish those principles on the basis that election proceedings are sui generis; and that, though “they are civil by nature, they are subject to their unique procedures”. He further observed that the legal position whether unpleaded matter which is subsequently revealed through scrutiny could be used to nullify an election was unclear from the recent jurisprudence. In his opinion, there are different viewpoints on this question. He identified Peter Gichuki King’ara V Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 2 others, [2014] e KLR. Gatirau Peter Munya V. Dickson Mwenda Kithinji & 2 others, S. C. Petition No. 2B of 2014 and the S.C. and Zacharia Okoth Obado V Edward Akong’o Oyugi & 2 others, [2014] eKLR as some of the decisions expressing varied positions. The learned Judge himself appeared persuaded by the decision of the High Court in Musikari Nazi Kombo V Moses Masika Wetangula & 2 others (2013) eKLR, which was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court in Moses Masika Wetangula V. Musikari Nazi Kombo & 2 others [2015] eKLR to the effect that, in the wider interests of electoral justice, the court cannot condone an “illegality in the election process, and would therefore investigate any alleged breaches of the law, even where these were not in the pleadings but arose in the course of the trial.”",
            "Applying that proposition to the facts before him, the Judge maintained that, as an election court he could “look at the material that emerged from a scrutiny or recount and which is unpleaded and make a decision one way or the other with respect to the same. A court is not precluded from studying the materials merely because the same was not pleaded”.",
            "Turning to the 1st respondent’s written submissions and the hand-written notes (not the report) of the Deputy Registrar of partial scrutiny, the Judge identified four (4) instances of non-compliance with the law relating to election and irregularities in the election that emerged from the scrutiny exercise and gleaned from the hand-written notes. They were: failure to put and seal in the ballot boxes all the ballot papers, whether valid or rejected with the result that 566 ballots in 184 polling stations were unaccounted for; counterfoils of used ballot papers were not in the ballot boxes, resulting in uncertainty of ballot papers in 11 polling stations; absence of Form 37A in the ballot boxes in 12 polling stations; and 111 ballot papers were found in the ballot boxes during recount which were not issued out of the ballot booklets for the relevant polling stations as they could not be traced to the counterfoils of used ballot papers.",
            "To answer the all important question, whether the election before him was conducted substantially in accordance with the Constitution and the relevant electoral law, the Judge came to this conclusion;",
            "“His petition was grounded solely on matters around the counting and declaration of results. The 3rd respondent did not raise any issues at all regarding the entire electoral process, from the campaigns to the declaration of results. I can in the circumstances conclude that the first phase of the election, the campaigns and the voting processes, was substantially conducted in accordance with the Constitution and the electoral law. It cannot be said that first phase of the election was conducted so badly that there was really no election at all. However, it has emerged from the material generated by the scrutiny that there were irregularities or non-compliance with the law on elections. The question then is whether these irregularities or errors or non-compliance with the law should invalidate the election the subject of these proceedings……. The irregularities identified relate to material that ought to have been found in the ballot boxes during recount.......The record of the forms used by the",
            "Deputy Registrar during the recount reveal that in 11 polling stations the counterfoils of the used ballot papers are missing……It cannot be ascertained therefore how many ballot papers were issued to electors and used, and therefore it would mean that the results cannot be ascertained and verified….. the handwritten record of the forms that the",
            "Deputy Registrar prepared for the scrutiny discloses that in 12 polling stations there were no Forms 37A in the ballot boxes, and in 12 other polling stations copies of the Forms 37A found in the boxes were totally illegible. Form 37A is a critical document for the purpose of collation, tallying and declaration of results. Without the form, or even where the same has been rendered useless by illegibility, there cannot be any results to declare, as it is, it is this document which authenticates the results. This would effectively mean that the results of the election in the 26 polling stations have not been authenticated and validated…….The total excess ballot papers cast amounted to 111. This is an irregularity that seriously undermines the electoral process as it suggests that these materials were introduced into the ballot boxes unprocedurally........ The excess votes are not authentic and should not be in the system. Such ballots could only get in through an illegal process, and an outcome which is arrived at with such votes being taken into account cannot be said to be fair or accurate or authentic or verifiable”. (our emphasis).",
            "With that, the learned Judge came to the ultimate conclusion that the election of the Governor, Embu County;",
            "“…..was substantially conducted according to the law, save for the irregularities noted during the recount. ….. that the irregularities or errors or non-compliance with the law during the collating, counting and tallying of votes in the gubernatorial election held for Embu County on 8th August 2018 undermined the electoral process fundamentally and produced a result that cannot be said to be accountable, verifiable or accurate”. (Our emphasis).",
            "While the report of the Deputy Registrar showed that the difference between the votes garnered by the appellant and the 1st respondent was between 700 and 800 votes in favour of the former, and whereas the 1st respondent’s own estimation was that the margin was in the region of 500 votes, the learned Judge for himself estimated the ballots affected by the missing counterfoils to be “about 4,000” votes, those relating to missing or illegible Forms 37A were “in excess of 10,000” votes and the excess votes amount to 111. In the learned Judge’s estimation, he stated, “looking at all these figures globally, there is no doubt that the irregularities would affect the final results of the election”.",
            "With that, the petition was allowed, leading to the nullification of the results of the Embu County gubernatorial election with costs.",
            "The appellant has challenged that determination on 23 grounds that have been condensed in the written submissions and argued in seven clusters.",
            "In the first place, the appellant submitted that the learned Judge erred in law in failing to refer to the Deputy Registrar’s report, which formed part of the record pursuant to an order of 18th January 2018, and instead used documents purported to be handwritten copies of forms allegedly used by the Deputy Registrar which were annexed to the 1st respondent’s List of Authorities and therefore not forming part of the court record; that despite the 1st respondent’s prayer for the examination of the packets of counterfoils being denied, the learned Judge made significant findings on the alleged irregularities on the missing counterfoils; that he did so purely on the basis of a document he baptized: “The Handwritten notes of the Deputy Registrar”.",
            "Secondly, the appellant complains that the learned Judge erred in sanctioning the unlawful execution by the 1st respondent of ex-parte orders of Muchemi, J. of 28th and 31st August, 2017; that the abuse of the ex parte orders went to the root of the integrity of the electoral material and it was unconscionable to permit the 1st respondent to benefit from the abuse of those orders by tampering with the preservation of the material. By the two orders in question Muchemi, J.in chambers ordered that, pending the hearing and determination of the application, an order do issue;",
            "“....for  the  preservation  and  safekeeping  of  all  the Kenya Integrated Electoral Systems Kits(KIEMS) .....and all the election materials used for all the polling stations and tallying centres with respect to the gubernatorial election for Embu County.”",
            "She further ordered that;",
            "“...the 1st and 2 nd respondent to allow the applicant to fix their own seals on the ballot boxes named in orders 1 and 2 above and/or place/fix their own locking gadgets to the rooms or premises where the materials are kept. The seals and locking gadgets of be placed/fixed by the applicant will be in addition to those already placed/fixed by the 1st and 2nd respondents.... the County Commissioner, Embu under whose jurisdiction the electoral materials are kept by the 1st and 2nd respondents, do provide security for the fixing of seals and locks as ordered earlier in sub-counties named in this application. That the applicant, the 3rd and 4th respondent be represented in the exercise by lawyers and two agents in each sub-county storage premises. That the applicant, the 3rd and 4th respondent will not participate in the exercise personally and should keep off their supporters from the exercise and from the premises in question. The 2nd respondent to file a report on the exercise in court and on the compliance of the orders within seven (7) days”.",
            "On the third cluster, it was contended that the learned Judge erred in holding that the evidence before him was sufficient to grant the order of scrutiny and recount; that there was no basis laid to warrant an order for scrutiny and recount except on the account of a narrow margin only; that by seeking to scrutinize 426 of the 710 polling stations, constituting 60% of the polling stations within Embu County, the 1st respondent was engaged in a fishing expedition. In the same vein, it was argued that the 1st respondent did not provide evidence to justify an order of re-tallying of all the Forms 37As, 37Bs and 37Cs.",
            "The fourth ground is to the effect that the learned Judge erred in determining the petition on the basis of matters beyond the pleadings and evidence presented before him in the petition; beyond the scope of the petition and his own ruling on scrutiny and recount dated 18th January 2018; and against the scrutiny report.",
            "We were urged on the fifth ground, to find that the learned Judge erred in his conclusion that there were irregularities that violated Regulation 81 (2) of the Elections (General) Regulations, 2012 with regard to the sealing of counterfoils in the ballot boxes, and concerning the status of some Forms 37A despite evidence to the contrary; that in so holding, the learned Judge misconstrued, misinterpreted and misapplied Regulation 81 aforesaid on the question of counterfoils; that he ought to have considered and applied Regulation 73(4).",
            "We were asked to allow the appeal on the sixth ground because as far as the appellant was concerned, the learned Judge had no justification in holding that there were irregularities, errors or non-compliance with the law during collating, counting and tallying of votes that affected the results; that in putting the difference between the appellant’s and the 1st respondent’s votes at 700 and 800 in addition to 566 votes from what he termed as votes from non-compliance with regard to unaccounted ballot, 4,000 votes relating to missing counterfoils affecting ballots and over 10,000 votes unaccounted for in respect of the illegible or missing Form 34As, the learned Judge went beyond the scope of the 1st respondent’s case as pleaded and presented.",
            "On the seventh and final ground, it was contended that the learned Judge misapplied the principles of the standard and burden of proof; that the burden was on the 1st respondent to establish that the irregularities he identified in his petition and in evidence were enough to justify the invalidation of the election; that he was required to prove that the votes cast in the three constituencies, Manyatta, Runyenjes and Mbeere South, exceeded the number of the registered voters; that the allegation was rebutted by the entries in Forms 37Bs and 37Cs of the three constituencies and the testimonies of the 2nd and 3rd respondents’ witnesses, to the effect that those who voted were less than the registered voters.",
            "Because the 2nd, 3rd and 4th respondents are on the same side of the divide with the appellant in their support of this appeal, we next consider their arguments.",
            "The 2nd and 3rd respondent filed a cross appeal on 27th March, 2018. The grounds upon which it is premised are similar to those in the appellant’s memorandum of appeal and can be summarized as follows: that the learned Judge enlarged the petition by considering new issues that were not pleaded in the petition and new evidence tendered during submissions; disregarded section 82 of the Elections Act, and expanded the purpose and intent of the scrutiny; it had not been demonstrated or proven how the final statistical outcome of the elections had been compromised by irregularities; and the Judge wrongfully exercised his discretion in condemning the 3rd respondent to meet costs of the petition. They have asked the Court to set aside the judgment and decree of the High Court dated 22nd February, 2018, and the dismissal of the petition with costs to the 2nd and 3rd respondents.",
            "Whereas the 4th respondent, by and large agrees with the foregoing submissions, he however is concerned with how the Judge treated the question of interference by the 1st respondent with electoral material following the orders of Muchemi, J. directing the preservation and safe keeping of the said electoral materials; that after holding that he would answer that question in the judgment, the learned Judge, in the judgment categorically stated that the issue was irrelevant; that in the end the question whether or not Muchemi, J. had, in the first place jurisdiction to entertain the application, not being a gazetted Judge for that election, was never determined. Further, it was submitted for the 4th respondent, that the learned Judge erred in allowing scrutiny and recount solely on account of a narrow margin of victory; that since the 1st respondent was convinced that in the event of a recount, he would emerge the winner of the gubernatorial election, it was erroneous for the Judge to go beyond this limit; and that clearly the application for scrutiny and recount was only a fishing expedition and the grant thereof was equally an error.",
            "On the interpretation and application of Regulation 81 of the Elections (General) Regulations 2012, it was argued that the Judge erred in holding that there were irregularities that fundamentally affected the election.",
            "Responding to these submissions, the 1st respondent denied interfering with the electoral material and insisted, instead, that under Regulation 93 of the Elections (General) Regulations 2012, the custodian of all the ballot boxes and material is the 3rd respondent; that indeed, the 3rd respondent confirmed that it had safe and secure custody of the materials under a 24 hour security; and that the orders issued by Muchemi, J. were carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the 3rd respondent’s officials, who confirmed that neither the 1st respondent nor his agents interfered with the electoral materials.",
            "On the question of scrutiny, the 1st respondent believed that he laid sufficient basis for the scrutiny of votes in all the 385 polling stations; and that considering that the appellant had garnered a paltry 985 votes more than what he himself got; he argued that the learned Judge properly exercised his discretion in granting an order of scrutiny.",
            "The 1st respondent rejected the suggestion that the Judge went beyond the pleadings and evidence before him and explained that the Judge relied partially on the scrutiny report from the Deputy Registrar; that all the irregularities and illegalities which were unearthed during the scrutiny exercise and detailed in the Deputy Registrar’s report were exhaustively pleaded in the petition; that the “handwritten notes” formed part of the Deputy Registrars’ report and in any case the typed report was generated from the handwritten report. It was the 1st respondent’s submission that he had demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt from the irregularities identified in the process, how the final statistical outcome was thereby affected; and that even from the scrutiny exercise, it was not known with certainty what the actual numbers were or the real vote margin. Accordingly, the discrepancies observed revealed the variance of the total votes cast for the position of Governor, Senator and Women Representative, hence the election was not verifiable, accountable, secure and transparent.",
            "Noting that there are three schools of thought on how to deal with matters, which, though not pleaded, are disclosed in the process of scrutiny, the 1st respondent urged us to accept the school that postulates that an election court cannot turn a blind eye on serious electoral malpractices or irregularities exposed by scrutiny or recount merely because such malpractices or irregularities were not pleaded as was stated in Musikari Nazi Kombo V Mose Masika Wetangula & 2 others, Election Petition (Bungoma) No. 3 of 2013.",
            "The 1st respondent urged that he had demonstrated that the counting and tallying process during the election was so badly conducted and managed by the 2nd and 3rd respondents that it failed to comply with the Constitution and other laws relating to elections. He reiterated in closing that in terms of section 83 of the Elections Act, where an election is conducted in such a manner as demonstrably violates the principles of the Constitution and the law, such an election stands to be invalidated.",
            "To begin with, we remind ourselves of the following basic principles in the determination of any election dispute. By the provisions of Section 85A of the Elections Act, this Court has the power to hear appeals from the High Court in an election petition concerning membership of the National Assembly, Senate or the office of county governor on “matters of law” only. What constitutes “Matters of law” has been enunciated with reference to Section 85A aforesaid by the Supreme Court in Gatirau Peter Munya V. Dickson Mwenda Kithinji & 2 others [2014] eKLR, to mean a question or an issue involving ;",
            "“(a) the interpretation, or construction of a provision of the Constitution, an Act of Parliament, Subsidiary Legislation, or any legal doctrine, in an election petition in the High Court, concerning membership of the National Assembly, the Senate, or the office of County Governor;",
            "(b) the application of a provision of the Constitution, an Act of Parliament, Subsidiary Legislation, or any legal doctrine, to a set of facts or evidence on record, by the trial Judge in an election petition in the High Court concerning membership of the National Assembly, the Senate, or the office of County Governor;",
            "(c) the conclusions arrived at by the trial Judge in an election petition in the High Court concerning membership of the National Assembly, the Senate, or the office of County Governor, where the appellant claims that such conclusions were based on “no evidence”, or that the conclusions were not supported by the established facts or evidence on record, or that the conclusions were “so perverse”, or so illegal, that no reasonable tribunal would arrive at the same; it is not enough for the appellant to contend that the trial Judge would probably have arrived at a different conclusion on the basis of the evidence”.",
            "We entertain no doubt that the seven grounds argued before us and which we have set out in the preceding paragraphs concern matters of law and each can be subsumed in any of the above strictures.",
            "Secondly, the nullification test laid down by Section 83 of the Elections Act, makes a rebuttable presumption that the results declared by the electoral body are correct unless the contrary is shown. To invalidate an election therefore, is a weighty prospect and when necessary, it requires compelling and credible evidence. Section 83 states;",
            "“No election shall be declared to be void by reason of non-compliance with any written law relating to that election if it appears that the election was conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Constitution and in that written law or that the non-compliance did not affect the result of the election.”",
            "Section 83 is the legal threshold; the fulcrum upon which the decision to nullify an election rests. That threshold must be measured against the general electoral principles laid down in Articles 81 and 86 of the Constitution, that, inter alia, elections must be free and fair, conducted by secret ballot; free from violence, intimidation, improper influence or corruption, transparent and administered in an impartial, neutral, efficient, accurate and accountable manner; that whatever voting method is used, the system must be simple, accurate, verifiable, secure, accountable and transparent; that the votes cast are counted, tabulated and the results announced promptly by the presiding officer at each polling station; that the results from the polling stations are openly and accurately collated and promptly announced by the returning officer; and that there be in place appropriate structures and mechanisms to eliminate electoral malpractice, including the safekeeping of election materials.",
            "Section 83 further acknowledges that elections are conducted by fallible human beings, and errors are likely to occur in the process; consequently, it stipulates in effect that not all failures to comply with any written law relating to an election will lead automatically to nullification of the result. So long as it appears that the election was conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Constitution and written law or that any non-compliance with the Constitution and law did not affect the result of the election, the court will not nullify the results.",
            "The third principle that must naturally follow from the foregoing is that a party alleging that there was non-compliance with the Constitution and the law or that that the non-compliance affected the result of the election bears the burden to prove the claim in terms of sections 107, 108 and 109 of the Evidence Act. In election matters, it is established on both the burden and the standard of proof by the Supreme Court in Raila Odinga & Others V. The Independent Electoral And Boundaries Commission & Others, S. C. Election Petition No. 5 of 2013 and Raila Odinga & Another V. Independent Electoral Boundaries Commission & Others, S. C. Presidential Petition No. 1 of 2017, respectively that;",
            "“[195] There is, apparently, a common thread in…comparative jurisprudence on burden of proof in election cases…that an electoral cause is established much in the same way as a civil cause: the legal burden rests on the petitioner….",
            "[196] This emerges from a long-standing common law approach in respect of alleged irregularity in the acts of public bodies. Omnia praesumuntur rite et solemniter esse acta: all acts are presumed to have been done rightly and regularly. So, the petitioner must set out by raising firm and credible evidence of the public authority’s departures from the prescriptions of the law.” See Raila Odinga (2013).",
            "In Raila Odinga (2017) that Court developed this principle further stating that;",
            "“[132] Though the legal and evidential burden of establishing the facts and contentions which will support a party’s case is static and “remains constant throughout a trial with the plaintiff, however, “depending on the effectiveness with which he or she discharges this, the evidential burden keeps shifting” and “its position at any time is determined by answering the question as to who would lose if no further evidence were introduced.",
            "[133] It follows therefore that once the Court is satisfied that the petitioner has adduced sufficient evidence to warrant impugning an election, if not controverted, then the evidentiary burden shifts to the respondent, in most cases the electoral body, to adduce evidence rebutting that assertion and demonstrating that there was compliance with the law or, if the ground is one of irregularities, that they did not affect the results of the election. In other words, while the petitioner bears an evidentiary burden to adduce ‘factual’ evidence to prove his/her allegations of breach, then the burden shifts and it behoves the respondent to adduce evidence to prove compliance with the law......... [148] In many other jurisdictions including ours, where no allegations of a criminal or quasi-criminal nature are made in an election petition, an ‘intermediate standard of proof’, one beyond the ordinary civil litigation standard of proof on a ‘balance of probabilities’, but below the criminal standard of ‘beyond reasonable doubt’, is applied. In such cases, this Court stated in the 2013 Raila Odinga case that “[t]he threshold of proof should, in principle, be above the balance of probability, though not as high as beyond-reasonable-doubt….”",
            "The final principle relevant to this appeal is that our legal system being adversarial, it is left to each party to formulate and present his case in his own way, subject only to the basic rules of pleadings. Once framed, the party, for the sake of certainty and finality, is bound by those pleadings and cannot be allowed to raise a different or fresh case without due amendment. Without such amendments, the Judge, as an independent and impartial adjudicator, is similarly bound by what the party pleads and places before him.  See: Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & another V Stephen Mutinda Mule & 3 Others [2014] eKLR. We shall of course consider the so-called different schools of thought regarding this principle later in this judgment.",
            "Our starting point for now is a summary of the 1st  respondent’s case as pleaded and presented. That case expressed in the Petition before the trial Court was that:",
            "i. the 3rd respondent inflated record of results in favour of the appellant in particular polling stations thereby occasioning higher and exaggerated results for the latter,",
            "ii. the results were swapped to favour the appellant and disadvantage the 1st respondent in specified polling stations,",
            "iii. the results were doctored in named polling stations,",
            "iv. forms 37A were amended at the tallying centres to reflect fraudulent and fictitious figures in favour of the appellant some of which were recorded in video cameras,",
            "v. the 1st respondent’s agents were intimidated by the presiding officers,",
            "vi. there was widespread use, acceptance and submission of forms 37A and 37B that were not signed by agents,",
            "vii. the 3rd respondent allowed 964 votes in excess of the 700 legal limit for every polling station to be cast at Gategi Primary School Stream 1 polling station,",
            "viii. the 1st respondent’s agents were denied the opportunity to participate in vote counting and tallying at various polling stations and tallying centres,",
            "ix. forms 37A and 37B were not signed by all the candidates’ agents,",
            "x. the 2nd and 3rd respondents failed to display the results of the elections on the doors of the polling stations,",
            "xi. the 2nd and 3rd respondents refused to address serious concerns and objections raised by the 1st respondent and his agents in regard to the conduct of the vote counting and tallying process, and in particular they refused to receive or acknowledge receipt of the applicant’s written request to halt the process of declaring the results of the election until such grave concerns had been addressed,",
            "xii. the declaration results when the number of registered voters constituencies, number of votes cast exceeded the in   Manyatta   and   Runyenjes",
            "xiii. Form 37C of Mbeere South Constituency had similar results from different  polling   stations  for different candidates,  casting aspersions as to the credibility of results and therefore raising “the need for scrutiny and verification of the results in all such polling stations”,",
            "xiv. some Forms 37C and 37B for Runyenjes and Manyatta constituencies indicated that in many polling centres, total votes cast were the same across all the polling stations, in defiance of the common knowledge that it is not possible for all the polling stations to have the same number of voters “and therefore the need for scrutiny and verification of the results in all such polling stations particularly in these two constituencies”, and finally,",
            "xv.  the total number of votes cast in the other posts did not tally according to form 38C, 39C and 37C, which reflected the following results;",
            "a. Woman Rep     - 242,525",
            "b. Senator             - 251,564",
            "c.  Governor          - 253,163",
            "The 1st respondent was firm that the above acts of omissions and commissions were so grave that it was not possible to discern whether the results were a true, lawful and proper expression of the will of the voters in Embu County. He pleaded with the trial court:",
            "“... to do no less than order scrutiny, tally and recount of votes cast and/or appropriately nullify and declare invalid the alleged declaration, on 8th August, 2017 of the 3rd respondent as Governor of Embu County......that there was no proper tallying, count or totaling of the votes cast in the said election. In the circumstances there should be a scrutiny, recount, inspection and audit of the register of electors, used ballot papers and the counterfoils thereof, unused ballot papers, ballot boxes, returns, statutory documents, reports, Kenya integrated Election Management Systems machine and other election documents and materials.” (Our emphasis).",
            "In this regard the 1st respondent listed several polling stations where he claimed there were widespread electoral malpractices.",
            "We have highlighted the above passages because it is apparent to us, as it was obvious to the learned Judge, that the 1st respondent earnestly believed that the true outcome of the election lay in the scrutiny and recount of votes; that the outcome of his petition depended on the application for scrutiny and recount; and that through a recount, he would, no doubt emerge the winner. That was the heart of his pleadings and testimony.",
            "He is recorded as telling the trial court as follows:",
            "“I believe I won the Gubernatorial Elections held in Embu on … and I believe my victory was stolen......",
            "I am 100% sure if the court allows the counting of my votes, the people of Embu will get the real truth of what happened.....the calculation would end up with Wambora",
            "getting 96 717 votes and my total would be 97 286.....I would pray to court to order a recount so that we can get to know the genuine votes cast. My main prayer is scrutiny to make sure the state of the electoral materials, we count and get the actual totals (sic). That is what I ask for........All my evidence is aimed at seeking recount to get to the truth of the votes cast and the correct results.....the votes must have been doctored.",
            "We would like a recount to establish the truth......",
            "I had no issues with the voting process. The system employed by IEBC with regard to voting was okey with me. I have issues with the total votes announced. I have no issue with the votes in the ballot box....",
            ".....The presiding officer oversees the whole process. He works for long hours. It is normal for them to get exhausted. When mistakes are made, I am here because such mistakes. If they make mistakes the same ought to be corrected........There was no violence at all. Everyone entitled to vote voted, my only problem is counting and tallying.”",
            "It could not have been clearer, coming, as they say, from the horse’s mouth. And we could go on and on with many instances where the 1st respondent pleaded, indeed begged for recount and scrutiny.",
            "Precisely because of his resolve, the 1st respondent, at the conclusion of the trial, took out two motions on notice principally for this objective; to prove that it was him and not the appellant who won the election. In granting him his wish with regard to the first application, the learned Judge ordered for partial scrutiny of votes “limited to recount and ascertainment of the number of votes each candidate garnered” in the specified polling stations in Mbeere South, Manyatta and Runyenjes Constituencies; that thereafter, there be a partial scrutiny of Forms 37B for Mbeere South, Manyatta and Runyenjes Constituencies as against Forms 37A limited to the named polling stations for purposes of re-tallying; that the exercise would be undertaken under the supervision of the Deputy Registrar of the court; and that the Deputy Registrar would at the conclusion of the exercise, “prepare and place on record a detailed report of his findings, which report shall form part of the proceedings of the court”.",
            "The second application sought the extension of the scrutiny exercise limited to re-tallying to include all Forms 37A and 37B in respect of all the polling stations within Embu County and in the alternative, that the earlier ruling on scrutiny be reviewed to include a scrutiny of Forms 37B for all the four (4) constituencies as against all Forms 37A for all the 710 polling stations.",
            "This was going to be a massive exercise cutting across the entire county. The court, in exercise of its discretionary powers, and in granting the alternative prayer, reviewed its earlier decision and ordered the inclusion of more polling stations in Manyatta constituency for a recount of votes. In the result, the Deputy Registrar was further directed to carry out a partial scrutiny of Forms 37A for all polling stations in Mbeere South, Mbeere North, Manyatta and Runyenjes Constituencies where a recount had not been ordered limited to tallying the figures in those forms with those in Forms 37B and 37C.",
            "The appellant and the 2nd and 3rd respondents have complained before us that the learned Judge erred in granting the two applications because, in so doing, he extended the scope of the petition and also because no basis was laid for the grant of the orders of scrutiny and recount.",
            "Whether or not to grant an application for scrutiny is a question that involves the exercise of judicial discretion. Once exercised, this Court will not easily overturn the decision unless the order made or denied resulted to an injustice, or exercise or denied without basis. See Gatirau Peter Munya (supra).",
            "Section 82 of the Elections Act grants an election court the power to order for a scrutiny of votes, either on its own motion or on application by any party to the petition during the hearing of an election petition. The scrutiny of votes will be ordered to be carried out in such manner as the election court may determine.",
            "The learned Judge was alive to this power and properly considered the conditions to be met before an order of scrutiny can be made. He supported his determination of this point with decided cases and the law, from which he was satisfied that there were sufficient grounds to warrant the issuance of the order for scrutiny in both rulings of 18th and 24th, January, 2018, respectively. The learned",
            "Judge, we find, judicially exercised his discretionary powers in the two rulings of 18th and 24th January, 2018, respectively. That ground must fail.",
            "The Deputy Registrar filed a report pursuant to the orders directing him to supervise the exercise. Because of its importance and we reproduce the Deputy Registrar’s report herebelow;",
            "“In the scrutiny of forms 37A, B and C we observed the following discrepancies;",
            "- In Munyori polling station code (072) number stream one of one form 37A shows Kithinji Kiragu garnered 21 votes while forms 37B and C shows he garnered 8 votes.",
            "Forms 37A shows Lenny Kivuti garnered 485 vote while forms 37B and C shows he garnered 453 votes. Leonard Muriuki is shown to have garnered 2 votes in form 37A while forms 37B and C show him to have garnered 1 vote.",
            "Form 37A shows that Cyrus Njiru obtained 2 votes while forms 37 B and C show he scored 4 votes. Form 37A show that Peter Njagi garnered one vote while forms 37B and C show him to have scored 0 votes.",
            "Form 37A show Martin Wambora to have obtained 8 votes while forms 37B and C show that he actually obtained 11 votes.",
            "- The other observation worthy noticing is that the order issued on 18th January, 2018, required us to scrutinize votes in Gakundu Coffee Factory Streams 1 and 2 (code -003), however the correct code for this polling station is 002 and this polling station has one stream. Code 003 belongs to Gakundu Coffee Factory Offices. Upon perusal of the application filed by the petitioner for scrutiny, we realized that the petitioner had also sought scrutiny of the two polling stations.”",
            "From this report there was evidence that the results declared did not change in terms of which party had more votes.",
            "The learned Judge being satisfied that with that report, the prayers A (a re-tally of the votes) and B (for scrutiny and recount) were spent, leaving prayers C (for a declaration that the appellant and the 4th respondent were not validly elected), D, that the election of the appellant as the Governor of Embu be determined and declared null and void), E. (a declaration that the 1st respondent was validly elected as the Embu County Governor) and issues of costs.",
            "The Judge was of the correct view that the first two were disposed of by the two rulings allowing for scrutiny. He thus determined the remaining prayers;",
            "“30. The first two prayers in the petition are spent, that is those relating to re-tally, scrutiny and recount. They were disposed of in the two rulings that the court delivered on 18th and 24th January 2018, when it directed the Deputy Registrar to carry out a partial scrutiny limited to recount and re-tally. The Deputy Registrar carried out the exercise of partial scrutiny and has filed a report, from which it emerges that the 3rd respondent was the overall winner of the gubernatorial contest in Embu County. So those two prayers are not available for consideration. I am left with the remaining prayers – the nullification of the election of the 3rd and 4th respondents and the declaration of the petitioner as the person validly elected as Governor.",
            "31. I have read and re-read the remainder of the prayers in the petition, in particular prayers C, D and E, and I am persuaded that they are consequential to prayers A and B of the petition. I have carefully perused through the averments in the body of the petition and juxtaposed them against the prayers, and it would appear to me that the petitioner’s case, as laid out in the pleadings and the prayers, was geared to obtaining a recount of the ballots cast in the last election on the proposition that should there be a recount he would emerge the winner. The tenor of his pleadings is that something went wrong with the counting process resulting in the 3rd respondent being returned as victor. My reading of the averments is that upon a recount being done then all the issues raised in the petition would be answered. The principal complaints by the petitioner are detailed in paragraph 101 of the petitioner relating to inflated, swapped and doctored results, among others. His oral testimony too pointed to conduct of a recount as he was confident that he would emerge the winner. A recount showing him as the leading candidate would then lead automatically to a nullification of the results that returned the 3rd and 4th respondents as victors and a declaration, founded on section 80(4)(a) of the Elections Act, that the petitioner was the candidate who had won and who ought to have been issued with a certificate to that effect”. (Our emphasis).",
            "Clearly, with the result of the scrutiny contained in the Deputy Registrar’s report, the 1st respondent’s case collapsed. The appellant, who was the 3rd respondent in the court below, had more votes than the 1st respondent. The latter had, through and through, pleaded that the truth was in the recount and scrutiny of the votes. Both the 1st respondent and the learned Judge himself were satisfied with the report by the Deputy Registrar, save for the argument by the 1st respondent, that totals in the Deputy Registrar’s report were not correct; that the votes he garnered in Kiritiri Primary School stream 1 and Kagumoini Dispensary – Don Bosco stream 2 were understated; that according to his arithmetic the results of the partial scrutiny should have given the appellant a win by a margin of 520 votes or thereabout. But the learned Judge did not agree with the complaint stating that “either way the 3rd respondent would still be ahead”.",
            "No other question was raised to challenge the integrity of the exercise. Indeed, the Judge had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that, with the Deputy Registrar’s report, the remaining prayers C, D and E in the petition had effectively been disposed of with the result that the appellant was the winner of the contest. He said the following as if to conclude ultimately;",
            "“That would be the natural consequence of the prayers as set out in the petition. The scrutiny that was ordered in the rulings delivered on 18th and 24th January 2018 was partial, limited to recount of the ballots cast in specific polling stations with a view to ascertain the number of votes garnered by each of the candidates who participated in the election. The re-tallying was to a similar vein. Since that was done and the 3rd respondent emerged as the winner, it would appear that prayers C, D and E of the petition have been effectively disposed of”.",
            "Undoubtedly, that ought to have brought the matter to an end.",
            "However, appearing not to be satisfied with this outcome and appreciating the fact that he was about to venture into new matters outside the pleadings and evidence, the learned Judge sought to justify this departure. He turned to the handwritten notes from which he picked what he believed there were irregularities. He justified this course by relying on the decision in Moses Masika Wetangula V. Musikari Nazi Kombo & 2 others [2015] eKLR that a court cannot close its eyes to irregularities that emerge during scrutiny. He of course was alive to the fact that the alleged irregularities were not pleaded; and even that there are numerous binding authorities that have stood the test of time, all to the effect that the only way to raise issues in a matter is through the pleadings, such as Charles C. Sande V. Kenya Cooperative Creameries Limited Mombasa Civil Appeal No. 154 of 1992, Nairobi City Council V Thabiti Enterprises Ltd (EA) 1995-98) 231, and a more recent David Sironga ole Tukai V Francis arap Muge & 2 others (2014) eKLR, on the subject. The Judge, however sought to distinguish them, saying they related to civil proceedings while the matter before him was sui generis, where the court would have the liberty to consider new and unpleaded issue; that though the appellant did not have opportunity to address the new matters during the trial; and even though that may amount to an ambush, it was proper, nonetheless, to determine the new matters at that stage.",
            "The general principle is that scrutiny and recount are not designed to discover new evidence or stumble upon matters that were not contemplated or pleaded or raised during the trial. In Peter Gichuki King’ara V Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 2 others, (supra) the Supreme Court stressed that –",
            "“The law on scrutiny and recount … suggests that scrutiny and recount … is not a gambling exercise that sets the court to rummaging through the ballot boxes to see whether any scintilla of evidence of electoral malpractice or irregularity can be found. If the petition is based on any particular electoral malpractice or irregularity that would warrant scrutiny or recount of votes, the malpractice or irregularity must be pleaded and the evidence of such malpractice or irregularity laid out or established prior to an order for scrutiny or recount; the court must be satisfied that, on the basis of the evidence before it, it is necessary to call for a scrutiny and recount, if not for anything else, to confirm the truth of the particular evidence.”",
            "See also another Supreme Court case of Zacharia Okoth Obado V Edward Akong’o Oyugi & 2 others (supra).",
            "But the Judge relied on the High Court case of Musikari Nazi Kombo V. Moses Masika Wetangula & 2 others (2013) eKLR, which was upheld in the Supreme Court decision in Moses Masika Wetangula V. Musikari Nazi Kombo & 2 others [2015] eKLR where their Lordships stated that:",
            "“[137] Section 83 of the Elections Act empowers the election Court to declare an election to be valid or invalid, following an election petition, on the basis of certain conditions. The Court cannot appear to condone illegality in the election process, and would therefore investigate any alleged breaches of the law, even where these were not in the pleadings but arose in the course of the trial.”",
            "On two fronts, this authority does not overturn the earlier decisions cited above, Peter Gichuki King’ara (supra) and Zacharia Okoth Obado (supra). First, in Moses Masika Wetangula (supra) the Court was dealing with a situation of an illegality as opposed to an irregularity. It was a case where election offences of treating of voters and bribery contrary to sections 62 and 64, respectively, of the Elections Act had been alleged. The election court, by the provisions of Section 87(1) of the Elections Act, was required to investigate the alleged offence before making a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Secondly, the case made it clear that the court could address such questions, though not pleaded, so long as they arose in the course of the trial. The other distinguishing factor in that case is that the illegality was infact pleaded, evidence presented and tried as expressed by the election court (Gikonyo, J.) in this passage in the judgment;",
            "“In the instant case, however, the malpractices have been properly pleaded and laid bare before the court. What is remaining is to establish;",
            "1)  whether the malpractice was as a result of the scheme allegedly contrived by the 1st Respondent to subvert the electoral process; and",
            "2) whether the malpractice impeached the integrity of the electoral process, thus, affecting the validity of the results?”",
            "The Supreme Court, we believe, has settled this question without doubt in Zacharia Okoth Obado, (supra) which bears some similarity to the instant appeal. In that case the Court delivered this position, reproduced in extenso because of its importance;",
            "“[150] The appellate Court in its Judgment relied on the Deputy Registrar’s report, and made observations on matters that had not been indicated as “disputed,” in the trial Court. A reading of the record shows that the Deputy Registrar, after re-tally, found that the winning margin of the returned candidate, had increased. Such is a factor which the Court of Appeal ought to have taken into account, rather than just highlighting the irregularities, oblivious to their lack of effect upon the declared results – which lack of effect the Deputy Registrar’s report had illuminated. Besides, the trial Judge is not to be faulted for upholding the appellant’s right to fair trial, by disallowing surprise “new pleadings” by 1st respondent at the stage of final submissions.",
            "[151]   In our opinion, the trial Judge rightly refused to consider any issues that had not been canvassed fairly, such as the introduction of new matters which had not been disputed by the petitioner.........It is worthy of note that the trial Judge, after deciding as he did, considered the effect of the irregularities on the election results, and found that these irregularities did not affect the declared result, the declared winner was still in the lead, and the candidate falling in the second position (1st respondent herein) retained that position.",
            "[152].......... The process of scrutiny, recount or re-tally is not to be used as a fishing expedition, enabling a petitioner to secure evidence in support of impromptu claims. This Court, in the Peter Munya Case, cited with approval the decision of Odunga J. in Gideon Mwangangi Wambua & Another v. IEBC & 2 Others, Mombasa Election Petition No. 4 of 2013 (consolidated with Election Petition Cause No. 9 of 2013), bearing the following passage (paragraph 26):",
            "‘The aim of conducting scrutiny and recount is not to enable the Court [to] unearth new evidence on the basis of which the petition could be sustained. Its aim is to assist the Court to verify the allegations made by the parties to the petition, which allegations themselves must be hinged on pleadings. … Where a party does not sufficiently plead his facts with the necessary particulars but hinges his case merely on the documents filed pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules, the Court would be justified in forming the view that the petitioner is engaging in a fishing expedition or seeking to expand his petition outside the four corners of the petition.’",
            "[153]  We hold it to be improper that, when re-tally is conducted, a party should take this as an opportunity to introduce new spheres of disputes, which had not been signalled in his or her original pleadings. It is vital, in election disputes, that the respondent should know the case that faces him or her. Hence the petitioner ought to have indicated in his or her pleadings the disputed matters, with clarity and specificity, as a basis for being allowed to urge that there were irregularities in those spheres, after re-tally has been conducted. However, where a trial Court exercises its discretion and, suo motu, orders a scrutiny, recount or re-tally, revealing irregularities other than those that were pleaded, then there is a proper basis for any party to pose questions upon such new findings; and the Court then will make findings on the effect of those irregularities on the declared results”. (Our emphasis).",
            "We have highlighted the last sentence because that is where the distinction lies. That it is only in situations where the court in exercise of its discretion orders, suo motu, a scrutiny, recount or re-tally, and irregularities other than those that were pleaded are revealed, the new irregularities may be relied on in the final determination of the petition if parties are availed opportunity to pose questions upon such new findings. But if a party petitions an election court alleging non-compliance with any written law relating to that election or that the nature of non-compliance was such that the result of the election was affected, then the party is bound by those averments because the burden remains upon that party to bring evidence in proof. Thereafter, the petition must be decided on the issues on the record; and if it is desired to raise other issues, they may be placed on the record only by amendment of the petition.",
            "It was not open to the learned Judge to rummage through “handwritten notes” and the 1st respondent’s submissions to find something to use to nullify the appellant’s election when the order for scrutiny was unambiguous. The Deputy Registrar was directed, in the relevant part of that order to “prepare and place on record a detailed report of his findings”. That report, the Judge further directed, was to “form part of the proceedings of the court”. In his own ruling of 13th February, 2018 the learned Judge was more than clear that;",
            "“The parties are to submit on the basis of the Report of the Deputy Registrar; and shall limit their submissions to points of law and the facts set out in the report. The opportunity to file written submissions should only be limited to the setting out of the legal arguments of the parties and not to introduce evidential material. I shall accordingly order that the Petitioners written submissions be limited to arguments and legal authorities. Any other document of evidential nature be excluded. Counsel to submit purely on the basis of the report of the Deputy Registrar as that is what is part of the proceedings.” (Emphasis supplied)",
            "The Supreme Court in Evans Odhiambo Kidero & 4 Others V. Ferdinand Ndungu Waititu & 4 Others [2014] eKLR stressed the importance of the scrutiny report; that scrutiny is a necessary tool in assessing the credibility of the election and the court must take the scrutiny report into consideration in arriving at its determination; that, if there are questions regarding the report, parties must be allowed to interrogate it; that if there are newly discovered irregularities, the petitioner must identify them and show how those irregularities affected the results; and that it is only then that the court will determine the petition. Again, in the instant dispute, the  1st  respondent identified  for  himself  what  he  perceived  to   be irregularities. The trial court considered it and found it had no substance and rejected it.",
            "We can do no better in this regard than to paraphrase Lord Denning in Jones V. National Coal Board [1957]2 QB 55 - that in the system of trial, the judge sits to hear and determine the issues raised by the parties, not to conduct an investigation or examination on behalf of the parties or society at large; that justice is best done by a judge who holds the balance between the contending parties without himself taking part in their disputations; and that the court’s determination must always be based, not on speculations but facts and the law.",
            "Having found that the learned Judge committed an error of law in delving into matters not pleaded or argued before him, we now turn to consider the merits of the grounds upon which the learned Judge invalidated the appellant’s election. Basing his decision on the handwritten notes of the Deputy Registrar, the learned Judge identified the following four (4) instances of non-compliance with the law;",
            "a) that the 2nd respondent failed to put and seal in the ballot boxes all the ballot papers used in the election, contrary to Regulation 81; that 566 ballots in 184 polling stations were unaccounted for based on the fact that the ballots actually cast are less than the total number of counterfoils of used ballot papers; and that it was difficult to tell whether they were spoilt or rejected or valid, and if valid in whose favour they were cast.",
            "b) that the 2nd respondent omitted to put and seal counterfoils of used ballot papers in the ballot boxes contrary to Regulation 81(1); that in 11 polling stations the counterfoils of the used ballot papers were not found in the respective ballot boxes; that it could not be ascertained therefore how many ballot papers were issued to electors and used, hence the results could not be ascertained and verified; and that the accuracy of the contents in Forms 37A could not be ascertained without the counterfoils of the ballots used in those polling stations.",
            "c)  that in 12 polling stations there were no Forms 37A in the ballot boxes, and in 12 other polling stations copies of the Forms 37A found in the boxes were totally illegible thereby the results in 26 polling stations could not be authenticated and validated.",
            "d)  that there were ballot papers found in 12 ballot boxes during recount which were not issued out of the ballot booklets for the relevant polling stations for they could not be traced to the counterfoils of used ballot papers found in the ballot boxes. The total excess ballot papers cast amounted to 111; that this constituted an irregularity that seriously undermined the electoral process as it suggested that these materials were introduced into the ballot boxes unprocedurally and intended to defeat or subvert and distort the will of the people.",
            "For the above four (4) factors, the Judge was persuaded that, by their nature, those irregularities affected the results. He concluded, rather strangely thus;",
            "“I have already made a finding that the election herein was substantially conducted according to the law, save for the irregularities noted during the recount. What I should determine is whether the non-compliance with the law or the errors noted affected the final results. According to the report of the Deputy Registrar, the final tally of the results shows that the difference between the votes garnered by the petitioner and the 3rd respondent is between 700 and 800 votes. The petitioner claims that that tally was erroneous and according to his own tally the margin is a little narrower and should be in the region of 500 votes. Are the irregularities identified through the scrutiny likely to affect the result? I have noted that the non-compliance with regard to the unaccounted ballots affects ballots in the region of 566 votes, while that relating to missing counterfoils affects ballots in the region of 4000 votes, while those relating to missing or illegible Forms 37A are in excess of 10 000 votes. The excess votes amount to 111. Looking at all these figures globally there is no doubt that the irregularities would affect the final results of the election........ It has not been established that the 2nd, 3rd and 4th respondents were complicit in any way to the non-compliance and the irregularities identified, which appear to have been caused either by fatigue or incompetence on the part of the elections staff hired by the 1st respondent”. (Our emphasis).",
            "The significance of the highlights in the above passage is three-fold. Under section 83 of the Elections Act, no election can be declared to be void for failing to comply with any written law relating to that election so long as it is apparent to the court, it was nonetheless, conducted in accordance with the Constitution and law or if the court is satisfied that non-compliance did not affect the result of the election. Therefore, if the court finds, as the learned Judge did, that the election was conducted substantially in accordance with the principles of the Constitution and the relevant law, then, without qualification, such election is not to be invalidated only on the grounds of irregularities. That is the position posited by the Supreme Court in Gatirau Peter Munya v. Dickson Mwenda Githinji and 2 Others (2014) eKLR, where it explained that;",
            "“ ..… If it should be shown that an election was conducted substantially in accordance with the principles of the Constitution and the Election Act, then such election is not to be invalidated only on ground of irregularities. Where however, it is shown that the irregularities were of such magnitude that they affected the election result, then such an election stands to be invalidated. …Where an election is conducted in such a manner as demonstrably violates the principles of the Constitution and the law, such an election stands to be invalidated.”",
            "In that same case, the Court underscored the fact that;",
            "“....procedural or administrative irregularities and other errors occasioned by human imperfection, are not enough, by and of themselves, to vitiate an election.”",
            "The other baffling question arising from the learned Judge’s penultimate determination reproduced above is this; by exonerating the 2nd and 3rd respondent from blame for the non-compliance and irregularities identified by the Judge and in attributing them to fatigue or incompetence on the part of the staff of the 3rd respondent, how could he find that such administrative errors as enumerated in the four (4) grounds affected the outcome of the election in the absence of allegation of any fraud, corruption or illegal practices? It is accepted that in any election, it is inevitable that procedural and administrative mistakes will be made and that if elections can easily be annulled on the basis of administrative errors, public confidence in the finality and legitimacy of election results will be eroded. See: Opitz C V. Wrzesnewskyj (2012) 3 S.C.R 76 where the Canadian Court stated thus:",
            "“…If elections can easily be annulled on the basis of administrative errors, public confidence in the finality and legitimacy of election results will be eroded. Only irregularities that affect the result of the election and thereby undermine the integrity of the electoral process are grounds for overturning an election.”",
            "It will be recalled that an application was made in which the appellant in essence questioned the integrity of electoral materials following the orders of Muchemi, J. for preservation. In determining that application, the Judge observed thus;",
            "“The 3rd  respondent..... argued that the electoral materials had been interfered with during the exercise that the petitioner undertook in execution of the orders that he had obtained in August 2017. Evidence was led on this aspect of the matter and it is an issue that I will have to determine in the final judgment”. (Our emphasis).",
            "In the judgment, he did not address that question but went on to find that there were administrative irregularities which he could not attribute to the 2nd and 3rd respondents. He nonetheless, went ahead to nullify election on the very issues he had postponed and declared irrelevant, without assigning any reason for that conclusion. We believe that had the learned Judge determined the merit of the complaint raised by the appellant regarding interference, for which evidence was led, he would probably have ascertained whether or not there was indeed interference with the material. That would have explained the doubts he entertained regarding their integrity.He would have known how the orders issued, ex parte by Muchemi, J. were executed.",
            "Regarding the four (4) grounds set out above, upon which the election was invalidated, we think there was no basis to say that failure to seal used ballot papers and counterfoils of used ballot papers in the ballot boxes; failure to locate some Forms 37A in the ballot boxes; the presence of ballot papers in 12 ballot boxes whose ballot booklets could not be located; and the alleged excess of 111 ballot papers, were irregularities of such magnitude that they seriously undermined and affected the election result. Conclusions made on the excess votes of 111, the vote difference between the appellant and the 1st respondent estimate by the learned Judge as “in the region of” 566, 700, 800, 4000, 10 000 votes were completely unsupported by any empirical proof and have no reference to any specific polling station. The 18 polling stations where the Judge found that the ballots cast exceeded the number of the ballots reflected in the counterfoils, and the 26 other polling stations where it was alleged that the ballot boxes did not have the requisite Forms 37A, were never specified. Also not named are the 11 polling stations where it was contended that the ballot boxes did not have the used counterfoils and 216 others said to have more counterfoils of the used ballot papers than the ballot papers found in the ballot box.",
            "Heavy weather was made over where the counterfoils ought to have been kept, with the learned Judge concluding that failure to seal used ballot papers and counterfoils of used ballot papers in the ballot boxes seriously undermined and affected the election result. Regulation 81(1)(d) of the Election (General) Regulations, 2012 as amended by L.N No. 72 of 2017, requires that upon completion of a count, including a recount, the presiding officer shall seal in each respective ballot box, counterfoils of used ballot papers sealed in a tamperproof envelope. Although Regulation 73 does not mention sealing the counterfoils in a ballot box, we are convinced from the plain reading of the two regulations that they are not in conflict with each other but must be read together. After the counterfoils have been placed in tamper proof envelope, the envelope is in turn sealed in the ballot box of the respective seat for which the election relates.",
            "The 1st respondent and, with utmost respect, the learned Judge, appeared preoccupied with the narrow margin of votes between the appellant and the 1st respondent. In its decision in the now so often cited in Gatirau Peter Munya (supra), the Supreme Court reiterated that;",
            "“[202] The issue of margins in an election other than a Presidential election, can bear only transient relevance and only where it is alleged that there were counting, and tallying errors or other irregularities that affected the final result. A narrow margin between the declared winner and the runner-up beckons as a red flag where the results are contested on allegations of counting and tallying errors at specified polling stations. Where a re-count, re-tally or scrutiny does not change the final result as to the gaining of votes by candidates, the percentage or margin of victory however narrow, is immaterial as a factor in the proper election-outcome.",
            ".......",
            "[205A] We would state as a principle of electoral law, that an election is not to be annulled except on cogent and ascertained factual premises. This principle flows from the recurrent democratic theme of the Constitution, which safeguards for citizens the freedom “to make political choices” [Article 38 (1)].",
            "For our part, we wish only to add that by Article 180(4) of the Constitution, a gubernatorial election where two or more candidates are nominated, an election shall be determined on the basis of “the candidate who received the greatest number of votes”.",
            "In conclusion, and to reiterate part of the ratio in Raila Amolo Odinga & Another V Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 2 Others (2017) eKLR, the burden of proof was on the 1st respondent to show either, that the conduct of the election in question substantially violated the principles laid down in the Constitution as well as other written law on elections, or that, although the election was conducted substantially in accordance with the principles laid down in the Constitution and other relevant laws on elections, it was fraught with irregularities or illegalities that affected its outcome.",
            "The 1st respondent’s assertion that more people (129,652) voted in Runyenjes Constituency when there are only 86,977; that in Manyatta Constituency, the total votes cast were 105,700, yet the registered voters were only 99,339, was not supported by the evidence before the court. That evidence showed that in respect of Runyenjes 71,195 out of 86,977 registered voters voted, while 79,964 out of 99,339 registered voters voted in Manyatta. In Mbeere South constituency where there are 72,143 registered voters, 58,127 of them voted, according to Forms 37Bs and 37Cs of the three constituencies. This information was authenticated by the evidence of DW-1 Amina Jarso, DW-2, Consolata Muthoni and DW-3 Faith Mugo who were the three (3) Returning Officers in the respective above-mentioned constituencies.",
            "It was clear from the above that the 1st respondent did not discharge the legal burden of proof to the required standards to show these alleged irregularities.",
            "From what we have said, that burden was not discharged and therefore the learned Judge erred in invalidating the appellant’s election as Governor of Embu County.",
            "Before we conclude finally, we give our reasons for dismissing the 1st respondent’s application dated 6th July, 2018. This is the background. After hearing this appeal and reserving judgment for today, 17th August, 2018, the 1st respondent, took out a motion on notice for the court to be pleased to call for the High Court file in Embu Election Petition No. 1 of 2017, Lenny Maxwell Kivuti Vs. Martin Nyaga Wambora & 3 others, in order to determine the documents filed by the Deputy Registrar as part of his report, and secondly, that we;",
            "“.....do consider the following pages in volumes 8-10 of the Record of Appeal in its final decision on the irregularities discovered in the election of Governor, Embu County....in order to determine the documents filed by the Deputy Registrar as part of his report, and to consider certain pages of that report and the decision of the court below on the question of excess votes, missing forms 37A’s and missing counter foils”.",
            "We heard arguments in the application on 27th July, 2018 and, finding no merit, ex tempore dismissed it with a promise to give our reasons for doing so in this judgment.",
            "The application was premised on the fact that during the hearing of the appeal, we asked questions regarding specific pages of the Deputy Registrar’s report dealing with the polling stations that had irregularities; that the record of appeal was not well paginated as it was haphazardly photocopied by the appellant making it difficult to refer the court to specific pages during the hearing; and that the irregularities as observed from the Deputy Registrar’s report contained in the record of appeal and as highlighted in the application are important for the Court to consider in the judgment. It was argued that although the Court had retired to write its judgment, it has jurisdiction to entertain the application before the judgment is delivered because the proceedings were yet to be concluded.",
            "The application was opposed by the respondents who argued that it was bad in law for lack of basis under any written law; that it was intended to introduce into this appeal issues of fact, contrary to section 85A (1) of the Elections Act; that it also violates rule 25 of the Court of Appeal (Election Petition) Rules, 2017 which prohibits interlocutory applications after the hearing of an appeal; that it was an attempt by the 1st respondent to re-open his case and tender evidence in apprehension of the outcome of the appeal after it occurred to the 1st respondent that he had not adequately responded to the arguments of the appellants and cross-appellants in their submissions and during hearing.",
            "We have considered these arguments. It suffices here to state that after parties are heard in an appeal, it is envisaged by the rules of this Court that the next stage is the delivery of judgment. It is expected also that through pre-trial administrative mechanisms of the Court, parties have opportunity to assemble all the material they wish to rely on when the appeal comes up for hearing. To obviate what, in common parlance is called hearing by installments, the rules allow the filing of supplementary record of appeal or amendment of the memorandum of appeal. But as far as we know, there is no procedure for what this application seeks.",
            "The 1st respondent in his written submissions summarized what he specifically seeks thus;",
            "“The application is premised on the fact that the court, when writing its ruling should be guided and well versed with the record of appeal. During the hearing of the appeal, it was clear that the court was not clear on some issues as highlighted by the parties and therefore it is incumbent upon the applicant to confirm that their case has been well represented and the court is clear on the various issues raised in the appeal”. (Our emphasis).",
            "We are not quite sure what to make of this submission, especially the emphasis. But perhaps that is why we find the application strikingly novel. The record of appeal, in compliance with rule 8 of the Court of Appeal (Election Petition) Rules, 2017 contains all the proceedings of the trial court without any need to point out to this Court where to find what, particularly when sufficient opportunity was availed to the 1st respondent before and during the hearing.",
            "The application is therefore superfluous and made on unfortunate assumption that the Court may overlook some aspects of the 1st respondent’s case in its judgment.",
            "In conclusion of this application, we reiterate what rule 25 (1) of the Court of Appeal (Election Petition) Rules, 2017 provides regarding the conduct of an election appeal before this Court. That;",
            "“25(1) At the conclusion of the hearing of an election appeal, the Court may make an order—",
            "(a)  dismissing the appeal;",
            "(b) declaring the election to be—",
            "(i) valid; or",
            "(ii) invalid.",
            "(c)  invalidating the declaration made by the Commission;",
            "(d) on payment of costs; or",
            "(e)  as it may deem fit and just in the circumstances”.",
            "It cannot, in our view be just and fit, in the circumstances of this case, to make an order to call for the trial court file in order to determine the documents filed by the Deputy Registrar, when, in fact, that record is what is reproduced in the record of appeal before us; and when that application does is to consume more judicial time and resources. The rule does not envisage the filing of “interlocutory” applications after the conclusion of a hearing.",
            "In terms of substance and procedure, this application is bereft, hence our decision of 27th July, 2018 to dismiss it. We award to the respondents in the application its costs. With the determination of the main appeal, the cross-appeal necessarily succeeds.",
            "In the result, we allow this appeal. Because the appellant was validly elected we set aside the judgment of the election court rendered on 22nd February, 2018 and subsequent orders. The costs of the appeal and cross appeal, to be met by the 1st respondent are awarded to the appellant, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th respondents, to be taxed, but not to exceed Kshs. 1,500,000.00.",
            "The appellant together with the 2nd, 3rd and 4th respondents shall have costs of the petition to be be borne by the 1st respondent, which are capped at Kshs. 3,000,000, to be shared equally and, of course, subject to taxation.",

The petitioner invoked Articles 10, 20,21,22,23,235,258 and 259 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010. The petitioner alleged contravention of fundamental rights and freedoms under Articles 27, 28, 41, 47 and 50 of the Constitution. The petitioner further invoked the County Governments Act, 2012 and brought the petition citing his purported interdiction as the chairman of the Embu County Public Service Board. The petitioner prayed for redress as follows:",

            "\tThe respondents opposed the petition by filing the replying affidavit of the Embu county secretary one Raymond Kinyua on 05.06.2015 through Ndegwa & Ndegwa Advocates. The petitioner filed his supplementary affidavit on 16.07.2015 in accordance with the leave granted by the court.",
            "\tThe petitioner filed the submissions on 16.07.2015 and the respondent filed the submissions on 06.08.2015. The petitioner’s and respondents’ respective advocates made elaborate and further oral submissions on 5.11.2015.",
            "\tDespite service the interested parties did not enter appearance, did not file any papers and did not attend the hearing.",
            "\tThe petitioner was appointed to hold the office of the chairperson of the Embu County Public Service Board. He was nominated and appointed by the Embu County governor with the approval of the Embu County Assembly as provided for in section 58(1) (a) of the County Governments Act, 2012.",
            "\tThe 2nd respondent addressed to the petitioner the letter dated 11.03.2015 Ref. EBU/CG/CPSB/1/34 titled “Complaints against Inept Performance of the Office of Chairman, Embu County Public Service Board.” The letter stated that there were numerous written and verbal complaints against the petitioner from the majority of the members of the Embu County Public Service Board, officials of Embu County Executive, many members of the County Assembly of Embu and members of the public residing in Embu County. The letter further stated that the 2nd respondent had inevitably decided to put the petitioner on notice to show-cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against the petitioner in 7 days. The letter set out the allegations against the petitioner as follows:",

            "\tThe petitioner replied by his letter dated 18.03.2015 Ref. No. EC/PSB.DISCP.24/VOL.I/38. In the reply the petitioner asked to be furnished with the copies of the written complaints, details of the verbal complaints including the maker, when, and the person they were made to, and the nature and legal basis of the disciplinary action the petitioner would face on account of such complaints.

The interdiction letter stated that the 2nd respondent had decided to interdict the petitioner with immediate effect to give an ad hoc investigating committee opportunity to investigate the complaints against the petitioner and subsequent recommendations for further action. The letter further stated that during the interdiction, one Secily Wanja Namu would perform the role of chairperson of the Embu County Public Service Board and in an acting capacity.",
            "\tFaced with the interdiction and having been precluded from performing the functions of his office as the chairman of the Embu County Public Service Board, the petitioner decided to file the present case.",
            "\tThe court has carefully examined the material on record towards unearthing the circumstances leading to the filing of the petition. In the supporting affidavit, the petitioner at paragraph 6 states that he earnestly believes that the 2nd respondent purported to suspend him on account of the petitioner’s refusal and unwillingness to compromise the independence of the Embu County Public Service Board and to aid and abet the 2nd respondent’s illegal schemes to circumvent the law and procedures in appointment and dismissal of county government workers. In that paragraph the petitioner states that in fact, the main bone of contention that triggered the government’s illegal decision to illegally suspend the petitioner and the Board secretary one Johnson Nyaga related to the termination of 60 Embu County employees by the second respondent in March 2014 during the 2nd respondent’s first impeachment by the Senate. The termination of the 60 employees who had been irregularly and un-procedurally employed was actually approved by the County Assembly, the 1st interested party in the present petition. The petitioner then continues to state as follows in the supporting affidavit, thus,",
            "“7. That upon the termination of the 60 employees some of them filed a case namely Petition No.14 of 2014 – Elias Mugendi & 41 Others –Vs- County Government of Embu & 2 Others. All the parties were initially represented by the Hon. Attorney General. However on 26.05.2014 the County Government contested the instructions of the Attorney General. Consequently by a letter dated 12.06.2014 the Hon. Attorney General sought clarification on the matter of representation but he reiterated that his office would continue to represent the Embu CPSB- in that matter. Annexed hereto marked “MNG5” is a true copy of the said letter dated 12.06.2014.",
            "8. That subsequently the law firm of R.M.Mugo & Company Advocates came on record for the Embu County Government and County Secretary and its major interest was to compromise the case in favour of the petitioners. However, when the Embu CPSB expressed unwillingness to compromise the said case, the said law firm started to claim it also acted for Embu CPSB on account of purported instructions by some members of the said Board. This matter of representation is yet to be fully resolved.",
            "9. That the foregoing notwithstanding, by a letter dated 28.01.2015 addressed to Ms. R.M.Mugo & Company Advocates, the petitioners’ lawyers in Petition No. 14 of 2014 Ms. Robson Harris & Company Advocates proposed terms for settlement of the said industrial dispute. Annexed hereto marked “MNG6” is a true copy of the said letter dated 28.01.2015.",
            "10. That by a letter dated 4.02.2015 Ms. R.M.Mugo & Co. Advocates agreed to proposed settlement in the following terms:",
            "It is in my earnest belief that the consent aforementioned was not in the best interests of the County Government of Embu and payment of salaries from February, 2014 to date is illegal, inter-alia, on the grounds that the Petitioners rendered no services to the people of Embu upon being lawfully terminated. Annexed hereto marked “MNG7” is atrue copy of the said letter dated 4.02.2015",
            "11. That pursuant to the foregoing by a consent letter dated 17.02.2015 Ms. Robson Harris & Co. Advocates and Ms. R.M.Mugo & Co. Advocates requested the deputy registrar of this honourable court to record the said consent. Atrue copy of the consent letter dated 17.02.2015 is annexed hereto and marked “MNG8”.",
            "12. That by the letter dated 18.02.2015 addressed to the Embu Acting County Secretary, Ms. R.M. Mugo &Co. Advocates requested facilitation of approval and adoption of the settlement aforementioned by the Embu CPSB to enable the filing of the same in the Industrial Court. Annexed hereto marked “MNG9” is a true copy of the said letter dated 18.02.2015.",
            "13. That in furtherance of the foregoing, by a letter dated 19.02.2015 the Acting County Secretary formally requested the Embu CPSB to approve and adopt the settlement aforementioned “in order to save us from a protracted legal battle that we are bound to lose in end”. Annexed hereto marked “MNG10” is a true copy of the said letter dated 19.02.2015.",
            "14. That in my considered opinion the request to approve the settlement could not be lawfully acceded to because the Board’s position all along has been that the decision of termination was made lawfully and procedurally and that position was easy to defend in court. However some Board members supported the request notwithstanding its patent illegality. In the premises the split between members of the Board in this matter explains the false accusations against the Board Secretary and myself by some members of the Board who support any request or proposal by the Governor.",
            "15. That in view of the foregoing I believe that the Governor made illegal decision to suspend the Board Secretary and I in order to secure a Board that would rubber-stamp his decisions and particularly to approve and adopt the settlement. In fact one of the allegations made against me is that I dismissed the concerned employees in disregard of law and procedure.",
            "16. That I believe the Governor has no power to suspend me from office and he is simply abusing his powers in furtherance of his scheme to reverse the lawful decision of the County Government of Embu and the CPSB to terminate the services of workers who had been engaged illegally.”",
            "\tIn the supplementary affidavit filed on 16.07.2015 at paragraph 8 the petitioner states that until the 2nd respondent started meddling in the affairs of the Embu Public Service Board, the Board had been having cordial working relationships and the animosity, if any, arose after the petitioner refused to rubberstamp the consent in the supporting affidavit marked “MNG-8” which was a scheme that would defraud the Embu County huge sums of money. In that paragraph, the petitioner states that to demonstrate that fact, a day after his alleged interdiction, the Embu CPSB met, though illegally constituted, and ratified the consent.",
            "\tThe respondents at paragraph 25 of the replying affidavit have stated that as regards the 2nd respondent’s decision to interdict the petitioner being based on the case in court, it is untrue and diversionary as the allegations raised against the petitioner are serious and substantial which cannot be excused and the actions by the 2nd respondent are justified as they defend the Constitution. At paragraph 26 of the replying affidavit it is stated that the petitioner in reply to the show cause notice did not raise the issue of the court case and therefore the petitioner has averred it as a mere afterthought. At paragraph 22 the replying affidavit states that the determination of the legality of termination of the 60 employees is subject to the pending petition 14 of 2014 at Nyeri and at paragraph 23, that the petitioner’s averments about R.M. Mugo &Co. Advocates relate to execution of professional duty by advocates on record and therefore are irrelevant to the matters in dispute.",
            "\tThe foregoing are the circumstances of the petition as far as the court could gather from the material on record. The court has considered the pleadings, the exhibits, the submissions and all the circumstances of the present dispute and proceeds to determine the issues in dispute as follows:",
            "\tThe 1st issue for determination is whether the petitioner’s interdiction by the governor of the county of Embu, the 2nd respondent, was lawful. It was submitted for the respondents that in view of the allegations leveled against the petitioner, the petitioner violated the provisions of Articles 10, 73, and 232 of the Constitution including but not limited to good governance, integrity, transparency and accountability and the violation of the Integrity Act. The respondents’ submissions essentially focused on attempting to justify that the petitioner, as alleged in the show cause notice and the interdiction letter, had engaged in gross misconduct that justified the interdiction. The court has perused the respondents’ oral and written submissions and nowhere do they point out the source of the 2nd respondent’s authority to interdict the petitioner save the submission that the 2nd respondent is the chief executive of the county government.",
            "\tSection 58(1)(a) of the County Government Act, 2012 provides that the chairperson of the County Public Service Board is nominated and appointed by the county governor with the approval of the county assembly. Section 58(5) of the Act provides that the members of the Board may only be removed from office on grounds set out for the removal of members of a constitutional commission under Article 251(1) of the Constitution; and by a vote of not less than seventy five percent of all the members of the county assembly. The grounds for removal under the said Article 251(1) include serious violation of the Constitution or any other written law, including a contravention of Chapter Six; gross misconduct, whether in the performance of the member’s or office holder’s functions or otherwise; physical or mental incapacity to perform the functions of office; incompetence; or bankruptcy.",
            "\tThe court has considered the grounds and the procedure for removal of the members of the Board who, include the chairperson of the Board.",
            "\tThe person desirous that the chairperson is removed from office must satisfy the substance and the procedure by first, alleging the details of the grounds that satisfy any of those enumerated in the Constitution and secondly, submitting the appropriate petition to the county assembly for the assembly’s consideration and resolution. There is no exception of application of the procedure where the removal is to be as desired by the county governor.",
            "\tArticle 179(1) of the Constitution is clear  that the executive authority of the county is vested in, and is exercised by, a county executive committee; Article 179(5) provides that the county governor and the deputy county governor are the chief executive and deputy chief executive of the county, respectively; and Article 183 (1) provides that a county executive committee shall implement county legislation; implement, within the county, national legislation to the extent that the legislation so requires; manage and coordinate the functions of the county administration and its departments; and perform any other functions conferred on it by this Constitution or national legislation. The court has considered those provisions and holds that the executive powers in a county government is vested in the county executive committee and with the governor as the chief executive to whom the executive committee members are accountable to as provided in Article 179(6). The court further holds that under Article 183, the function of the county executive committee is chained to implementing county and national legislation so that the committee or its members, including the governor and deputy governor as per Article 179(2), must show that the executive actions or omissions are founded upon some legislative provision. It is therefore the holding of the court that the governor, the deputy governor, the members of the county executive committee and indeed the county executive committee do not enjoy inherent executive powers outside of legislative provisions as may be provided in national or county legislation. To safeguard interests of the executive arm of the county governments, where it is desired to do that which is not provided in the legislation, Article 183 (2) of the Constitution provides that a county executive committee may propose legislation for consideration by the county assembly. It is the opinion of the court that until such legislation is prepared and enacted, the governor, the deputy governor and the members of the county executive committee by themselves or as a committee may not implement that which is not provided for in legislation; they do not enjoy inherent executive powers by which they can purport, by way of filling real or perceived gaps in the legislation, to act outside the law or where the law is silent or so to say, absent.",
            "\tIn the present case, the court finds that the 2nd respondent did not enjoy inherent disciplinary powers to impose the disciplinary sanction of interdiction against the petitioner as there was no constitutional or legislative authority or power for the 2nd respondent to act as he proceeded in the case.",
            "\tWhile making that finding the court upholds its opinion in Richard Bwogo Birir –Versus- Narok County Government and 2 Others [2014] eKLR thus, “To answer the 1st issue for determination being whether the pleasure doctrine applies in Kenya’s public service and particularly in this case, the court finds that the pleasure doctrine and the related doctrine of the servants of the crown does not apply in public and state service of the new Republic under the Constitution of Kenya, 2010.  The court further finds that the pleasure doctrine and the doctrine of servants of the crown did not apply and could not be legitimately invoked in the dismissal of the petitioner by the 2nd respondent as was purportedly advanced for the respondents.  Finally, the court holds that it is the doctrine of servants of the people and the doctrine of due process that apply to public and state officers in Kenya. The court further holds that it is through the application of the doctrine of servants of the people and the doctrine of due process of law that public and state officers in Kenya are subdued by the people who are the holders of sovereign power in the new Republic.”",
            "\tFurther,",
            "“The court has carefully considered the enumerated constitutional provisions and holds that all persons holding public or state office in Kenya in the executive, the legislature, the judiciary or any other public body and in national or county government are servants of the people of Kenya.  The court holds that despite the level of rank of state or public office as may be held, no public or state officer is a servant of the other but all are servants of the people.  Thus, the court holds that the idea of servants of the crown is substituted with the doctrine of servants of the people under the new Republic as nurtured in the Constitution of Kenya, 2010.  The hierarchy of state and public officers can be complex, detailed and conceivably very long vertically  and horizontally but despite the rank or position held, the court holds that they are each a servant of the people and not of each other as state or public officers.  They are all the servants of the people.  The court holds that there are no masters and servants within the hierarchies of the ranks of state and public officers in our new Republic.”",
            "\tAnd again the court upholds the opinion in Birir’s case on the demise of the pleasure doctrine and the doctrine of the servants of the crown, thus,",
            "“....In the new Republic, the court holds that public service by public and state officers is guided by the doctrine of servants of the people and the doctrine of due process and not by the doctrines of the servants of the crown and the  pleasure doctrine.  In the opinion of the court, the demise of the pleasure doctrine and the demise of the doctrine of servants of the crown in the new Republic’s constitutional framework constitute the very foundation of the Republic, namely, Kenya is a sovereign Republic and all sovereign power belongs to the people of Kenya and shall be exercised only in accordance with the Constitution.”",
            "\tThus, the court finds that in the present case, the 2nd respondent erroneously acted in the misconceived believe that the petitioner was his servant. The court finds that the petitioner was not the 2nd respondent’s servant but like the 2nd respondent, he was a servant of the people and the 2nd respondent was not the master of the petitioner. The court holds that in such circumstances, the 2nd respondent did not enjoy the inherent disciplinary powers of a master over a servant as such relationship did not exist at all. The petitioner’s service as a public officer was governed and based upon the provisions of the Constitution, legislation and governmental policies. It was a service free from the individual will or discretion of the petitioner or the 2nd respondent. And even if the discretion existed, but which the court finds did not in view of the statutory provisions on the removal of the petitioner from the office of the chairperson of the County Public Service Board, the court holds that the 2nd respondent acted unreasonably per Lord Green in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited –Versus- Wednesbury Corporation (1947) 2ALL ER 680 at 682-683 thus, “It is true the discretion must be exercised reasonably. What does that mean? Lawyers familiar with the phraseology commonly used in relation to the exercise of statutory discretions often use the word ‘unreasonableness’ in a rather comprehensive sense. It is frequently used as general description of the things that must not be done. For instance, a person entrusted with discretion must direct himself properly in law. He must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider. He must exclude from his consideration matters which are irrelevant to the matter that he has to consider. If he does not obey these rules he may truly be said, and often is said, to be acting ‘unreasonably’. Similarly, you may have something so absurd that no sensible person could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority. Warrington L.J., I think it was, gave the example of the red-haired teacher, dismissed because she had red hair. That is unreasonable in one sense. In another sense it is taking into consideration extraneous matters. It is so unreasonable that it might almost be described as being done in bad faith. In fact, all these things largely fall under one head.”",
            "\tThe court finds that the 2nd respondent failed to consider the clear statutory provisions that applied to the petitioner’s removal or disciplinary control and the court returns that the 2nd respondent’s  show-cause letter and then interdiction decision was unreasonable as was unlawful.",
            "\tTo answer the 1st issue for determination, the court returns that the petitioner’s interdiction by the governor of the county of Embu, the 2nd respondent, was unlawful as it was not founded upon a constitutional or statutory provision that vested upon the 2nd respondent disciplinary power to interdict the petitioner or to require the petitioner to show-cause as was done by the 2nd respondent.",
            "\tThe 2nd issue for determination is whether consequential to the interdiction of the petitioner, the 2nd respondent could lawfully appoint the 3rd respondent to act as the chairperson of the Embu County Public Service Board.  The County Government Act, 2012 does not empower the 2nd respondent to appoint an acting member of the Board.  As the 2nd respondent did not enjoy constitutional or statutory power to make such acting appointment, the court returns that the appointment was null and voided as it was founded upon the exercise of fictitious authority. The court has considered the provisions of section 64(2) of the County Government Act, 2012 that acting appointments shall be made only by the lawful appointing authority and for a specified period. Further, the court has considered the provisions of section 64 (1) of the Act that a person shall not be appointed to hold a public office in an acting capacity unless the person satisfies all the prescribed qualifications for holding that office. The court finds that in view of those provisions, the acting appointment was defective because it was indefinite and for want of approval by the county assembly as provided for in section 58(1) of the Act.",
            "\tThe 3rd issue for determination is whether the petitioner’s fundamental rights and freedoms and other constitutional protections were violated by the 2nd respondent. At paragraph 15 of the petition the petitioner has stated that the purported interdiction of the petitioner is a flagrant violation of  his fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in Articles 27, 28, 41, 47 and 50 of the Constitution. On this issue the findings of the court are as follows:",
            "\tThe 4th issue for determination is whether the decisions by the Embu Public Service Board made effective and after the date the petitioner was interdicted were null and void.  The court has found that the 2nd respondent lacked constitutional or statutory authority to appoint the 3rd respondent as the acting chairperson and that appointment has been found to have been illegal. The court finds that effective the date of the petitioner’s interdiction the Embu Public Service Board was defectively constituted as it could not lawfully exercise any of the powers and functions vested in the Board. Section 58 of the County Government Act, 2012 clearly spells out the Board’s membership as the chairperson, not less than three and not more than five other members and a certified public secretary of good standing all nominated and appointed by the county governor with the approval of the county assembly. Under section 58(2) the appointments are through a competitive process. The actions of the 2nd respondent to illegally interdict the petitioner and to unlawfully appoint an acting chairperson rendered the Board improperly constituted. Accordingly, all decisions made by the board and all consequential actions and omissions, as prayed for, are null and void ab initio.",
            "\tThe 5th issue for determination is whether the petitioner is entitled to compensation for the violation of the petitioner’s rights and fundamental freedoms. The court has found that the petitioner’s rights were violated. First is the violation of the petitioner’s right to fair labour practices. The court finds that flowing from that violation, the petitioner was subjected to unfair loss of the otherwise due income and the right to work as was duly appointed. The letter of appointment shows that the petitioner earned Kshs. 225, 000.00 per month and was interdicted effective 18.03.2015. The court finds that the petitioner is entitled to all withheld pay for 9 months making Kshs.2, 025,000.00 to be paid by the 1st respondent. While making that finding the court uphold its opinion in Kenya Union of Printing, Publishing, Paper Manufacturers and Allied Workers –Versus- Timber Treatment International Limited,[2013]eKLR, Industrial Cause No. 21 of 2012 at Nakuru, page 10-11, where the court stated thus “In making the findings the court considers that the employee is entitled to pay for the period he or she is kept away from work due to unlawful and unfair suspension or termination.  In such cases, the employee is entitled to at least partial reinstatement, and therefore compensation whose measure is the proportionate unpaid or withheld salary throughout that period of unlawful or unfair suspension or termination. During such period, the court considers that the employee carries a valid legitimate expectation to return to work and not to work elsewhere until the disciplinary or the ensuing conciliatory and legal proceedings are concluded. In arriving at the finding of entitlement to reinstatement during unlawful or unfair suspension and termination, the court has taken into account the provisions of subsection 49(4) (f) which states that in arriving at the proper remedy, there shall be consideration of, ‘(f) the reasonable expectation of the employee as to the length of time for which his employment with that employer might have continued but for termination;’. The court is of the opinion that for the period the question of unfairness or fairness of the suspension or termination has not been determined, the employee carries a reasonable expectation that for the period pending the determination of that question, the employment has not validly terminated and the employee is entitled to reinstatement during that period provided the employee is exculpated; with pendency of such serious question, the employee is validly expected to pursue the resolution with loyalty not to work for another employer.  It is the further opinion of the court that where the court finds that the suspension or termination was unlawful or unfair, the employee is entitled to at least partial reinstatement, and therefore, a total of the salaries due during that period.  The exception (to such entitlement to partial reinstatement for the period pending a final decision on the dispute) is where it is established that during that period, the employee took on other gainful employment or the employee fails to exculpate oneself as charged.”",
            "\tIn making upholding that opinion, the court further recognizes that the sections referred to in the quoted opinion are in the Employment Act, 2012 and there is no reason why they would not apply to state or public officers unless it is established that better terms of service were in place for that purpose. The court further uphold its opinion in the ruling of 06.03.2015 in Margaret Lorna-Versus- Embu County Government [2015]eKLR thus, “The second issue for determination is whether the office of the county secretary was excluded from the application of the Employment Act, 2007. The parties were in agreement that the office had not been excluded by the Minister under section 3 of the Act. The court finds as much and further holds that even if it had been excluded, the better or similar terms under the special arrangements as submitted for the claimant would need to be established so that the court would determine the case upon such special terms of service. Such better or similar terms, in the opinion of the court, would include the minimum safeguards of valid reasons; and notice and a hearing as provided in sections 43 and 41 of the Employment Act, 2007.  In the opinion of the court, the import and scope of the proviso to section 3(5) of the Act is that if the terms and conditions of the special arrangement of an excluded office are inferior to the terms and conditions provided under the Act, then the provisions of the Act will swiftly apply to the case by default. The court further holds that if an office is excluded from terms of the Act under section 3 of the Act, the court’s jurisdiction is not thereby ousted; the court will hear and determine that excluded employment dispute on the basis of the better terms of service as provided for in the special arrangement. Thus, the specific contractual terms would apply in determining the dispute.”",
            "\tTaking the quoted opinions into account, the court considers that the petitioner is entitled to the withheld pay throughout the period of the interdiction and within the right to fair labour practices under Article 41(1) and the general principles of fair terms of employment.",
            "\tThe court has considered the manner in which the 2nd respondent acted in this case outside the law and was keen to injure and deliberately continue the cited violation of the petitioner’s rights despite clear advice the Transitional Authority had given to him. On 30.04.2015 the Transitional Authority wrote as per exhibit MNG11 in reply to the 2nd respondent’s letter of 11.03.2015 regarding an advisory on the office of the chairman and the secretary of the Embu County Public Service Board. The Transitional Authority, inter alia, advised as follows:",
            "\tThe material before the court show that the 2nd responded failed to act as per the advice and instead allowed the petitioner’s lamentations about the violations of his rights to persist. The court finds that in the circumstances of the case the petitioner is entitled to compensation by the 2nd respondent for the violation and continued violation of the rights beyond the clear advice that the 2nd respondent was given by the Transitional Authority. As submitted for the petitioner, the 2nd respondent continued to violate the petitioner’s rights after  receiving the advice and the court finds that taking all the circumstances into account, the 2nd respondent’s violation of the petitioner’s rights was not in pursuit of justified or genuine governmental purpose.  It is the opinion of the court that it would be unjustified to burden the tax payer to meet the compensation for violation of the rights in this case whereby the 2nd respondent engaged in the illegalities and his actions were clearly in violation of the law and were advanced in clear disregard of the advice given by the relevant government agency. The 2nd respondent and not the tax payer is therefore found liable for the paying the compensation for the violation of the fundamental rights and freedoms.",
            "\tThere is no doubt that the petitioner was wronged. The court has considered the aggravating factors that the 2nd respondent disregarded the clear opinion of the court in the earlier decided case of Mundia Njeru Geteria- Versus- Embu County Government & 3 Others , Industrial Court Petition No. 116 of 2013  in which this court (Abuodha J) gave clear guidance and orders on the manner of handling the petitioner’s removal. The court has also considered that the 2nd respondent failed to heed the clear advice by the Transitional Authority in that regard. It was submitted for the petitioner that in view of the abuse of the law, disobedience of the court’s opinion and orders in the earlier decided case and the seriousness of the wrongs committed, the claimant had been dehumanized and an award of Kshs. 10,000,000.00 would meet the ends of justice. It was further submitted that the remedy of compensation recognizes that the petitioner was indeed wronged and the fact that the court order and guidance in the previous case between the parties had been disobeyed was a circumstance that aggravated the violation of the petitioner’s rights. Further, it was submitted that the 2nd respondent’s actions were not in furtherance of the government’s interest and so the government would not be liable for the violations.",
            "\tIn Arnacherry Limited –Versus- Attorney General [2014]eKLR the High Court ( Lenaola J) awarded Kshs. 3,000,000.00 where there had been violation of Article 40 on the right to protection of property and the petitioner having been fully compensated the value of the land at Kshs. 850,000.00 and the destroyed assets at Kshs. 30,000,000.00. In Mak’Onyango-Versus- Attorney General and Another [2013]1EA at 353 the High Court (Rawal J) awarded Kshs. 20,000,000.00  for violation of rights for unlawful and malicious arrest, search and detention during the aftermath of the attempted coup d’etat on 01.08.1982 and the same having amounted to torture, cruelty, inhuman and degrading treatment. ",
            "\tThe court has awarded the petitioner the full withheld salaries. Taking into account the cited cases and the awarded salaries the court finds that Kshs.10, 000,000.00 as submitted for the petitioner would be on the higher scale. The respondents on their part did not offer any submissions to guide the court on the quantum of the compensation. The court has already pointed out the aggravating circumstances as submitted for the petitioner and finds that Kshs. 5,000,000.00 for violation of the fundamental rights and freedoms will meet the ends of justice in this case.",
            "\tFinally, the court has revisited the petitioner’s written and oral submissions. There are no specific submissions urging for grant of a declaration that the 2nd respondent’s action of interdicting the petitioner was gross violation of Article 75 of the Constitution as was partly prayed for in prayer (f) in the petition. The court considers that the petitioner abandoned that part of the prayer or that the petitioner has by way of submissions failed to justify that part of the prayer. Thus, while allowing that prayer (f), the part the court has found unjustified or abandoned will be excluded as declined by the court.",

The notice of Motion shall be signed by the Member who affirms that the particulars of allegations contained in the motion are true to his or her own knowledge and the same verified by each of the members constituting at least a third of all the members and that the allegations therein are true of their own knowledge and belief on the basis of their reading and appreciation of information pertinent thereto and each of them sign a verification form provided by the Clerk for that purpose.\n\n(2) The Clerk shall submit the proposed Motion to the Speaker for approval.\n\n(3) A member who has obtained the approval of the Speaker to move a Motion under paragraph (1) shall give a seven (7) days notice calling for impeachment of the Governor.\n\n(4) Upon the expiry of seven (7) days, after notice given, the Motion shall be placed on the Order Paper and shall be disposed of within three days; Provided that if the County Assembly is not then sitting, the Speaker shall summon the Assembly to meet on and cause the Motion to be considered at that meeting after notice has been given.\n\n(5) When the Order for the Motion is read, the Speaker shall refuse to allow the member to move the motion, unless the Speaker is satisfied that the member is supported by at least a third of all Members of the County Assembly to move the motion; Provided that within the seven days’ notice, the Clerk shall cause to be prepared and deposited in his office a list of all Members of the County Assembly with an open space against each name for purposes of appending signatures, which list shall be entitled “SIGNATURES IN SUPPORT OF A MOTION FOR REMOVAL OF GOVERNOR BY IMPEACHMENT”\n\n(6) Any signature appended to the list as provided under paragraph (5) shall not be withdrawn.\n\n(7) When the Motion has been passed by two-thirds of all members of the County Assembly, the Speaker shall inform the Speaker of the Senate of that resolution within two days.”\n\n\t \n\n\tSection 91 of the County Governments Act establishes the modalities and platforms for citizen participation. It provides that the county government shall facilitate the establishment of structures for citizen participation including—\n\n\t \n\n“ a. information communication technology based platforms;\n\nb. town hall meetings;\n\nc. budget preparation and validation fora;\n\nd. notice boards: announcing jobs, appointments, procurement, awards and other important announcements of public interest;\n\ne. development project sites;\n\nf. avenues for the participation of peoples’ representatives including but not limited to members of the National Assembly and Senate; or\n\ng. establishment of citizen fora at county and decentralized units.”\n\n\t \n\nHeld;\n\n\t1.      The Government Proceedings Act only applied to civil proceedings by and against the Government and it did not apply to proceedings which were not of a civil nature such as criminal proceedings. Matters relating to the interpretation of the Constitution are not civil matters as contemplated under the Government Proceedings Act but are proceedings sui generis.\n\n\t2.      Article 156(4) (b) of the Constitution only dealt with legal representation of the National Government in Court or in any other legal proceedings to which the National Government was a party. It neither dealt with criminal proceedings nor did it require that the Attorney General be a party to the proceedings.\n\n\t3.      Rule 2 of The Constitution of Kenya (Protection of Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) Practice and Procedure Rules, 2013, otherwise known as the Mutunga Rules, defined “respondent” as meaning “a person who is alleged to have denied, violated or infringed, or threatened to deny, violate or infringe a right or fundamental freedom.” It followed that the said Rules contemplated that a person other than the Attorney General could be cited as a Respondent.   The failure to bring the proceedings against the Attorney General was therefore not fatal to the proceedings.\n\n\t4.      Nothing turned on the objection that the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC) ought not to have been a party to the proceedings as the said Commission was joined to the proceedings by an order of the Court which order had not been challenged either by review or on appeal and had not been set aside. In addition, it was not contended that the presence of the PSC had caused any prejudice to any party.\n\n\t5.      With respect to the immunities of the Senate and the Speaker of the Senate, section 4 of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act was clear that it applied only to criminal and civil proceedingsand matters relating to interpretation and application of the Constitution are neither criminal nor civil. To hold otherwise would amount to elevating the Senate and the Speaker above the Constitution as under articles 1 and 2 of the Constitution;\n\n\ta.     all sovereign power belonged to the people of Kenya and was to be exercised only in accordance with the Constitution\n\n\tb.     the Constitution was the supreme law of the Republic and binds all persons and all State organs; \n\n\ta.     no person may claim or exercise State authority except as authorized under the Constitution;\n\n\tb.     any act or omission in contravention of the Constitution was invalid.\n\n\t \n\n\t2.      The institution constitutionally mandated to hear and determine any question respecting the interpretation of the Constitutionincluding the question whether anything said to be done under the authority of the Constitution or if any law was inconsistent with, or in contravention of, the Constitution was the High Court under article 165 of the Constitution. It followed that no State Organ could hold itself to be immune to proceedings challenging the constitutionality of its actions and that included Parliament and its speakers. In other words immunity only applied to situations where the particular entity was acting constitutionally.\n\n\t3.      Article 3(1) of the Constitution enjoined every person to respect, uphold and defend the Constitution. Article 258 entitled any person to institute court proceedings, claiming that the Constitution had been contravened, or was threatened with contravention and such actions could be instituted by a person acting as a member of, or in the interest of, a group or class of persons or by a person acting in the public interest. It had not been contended that the petitioners were not entitled to bring the proceedings. The mere fact that the success of the proceedings could result in safeguarding and securing the 1stPetitioner’s position as the Governor, Embu County, did not disentitle them from instituting the proceedings.\n\n\t4.       In the current constitutional dispensation, the Courts had to resist the temptation to try and contain constitutional challenges in a straight-jacket and had to resist being rigidly chained to the past defined situations of standing and look at the nature of the matter before them. The petitioners could not be faulted for bringing the proceedings simply because they were perceived supporters of the 1st Petitioner.\n\n\t5.      For proceedings to be said to be sub judice, the same must be pending before the court or a judge for determination. The sub judice doctrine applied to situations where there were pending proceedings in a Court of law. A person could not institute proceedings in a Court of law with a view to stalling an ongoing legal process by relying on the sub judice principle. For sub judice to apply, the proceedings sought to be stayed ought to have been the ones subsequently commenced and not vice versa. In this case, Embu Petition Nos. 5 and 6 of 2014 were filed on the 28thApril 2014, whereas the Motion before the County Assembly was filed on the 16th April 2014 and notice given on 22nd April 2014. Therefore when the motion was instituted there was no pending matter in court in relation to the issues herein. The two petitions filed in court were withdrawn and discontinued immediately after the motion was passed on the 29th April 2014. The sub judice rule could not in the circumstances of the case be successfully invoked.\n\n\t6.      In interrogating the constitutionality of a provision of a statute, the starting point is statutory interpretation. There were several principles which had been developed over the years that had to be taken into account.\n\n\ta.     A statute was presumed to be constitutional unless the contrary was proved.\n\n\tb.     The courts were concerned only with the power to enact statutes not with their wisdom. Therefore, the primary role of the Court was to interpret the law, as enacted by Parliament, and that entailed giving effect to the legislative intent of Parliament. Thus, the Court was not concerned with ‘what ought to be’ but with ‘what is’,\n\n\tc.     The purpose and effect of the statute or provision impugned must be considered in determining the constitutionality or otherwise of a statute.\n\n\td.     The court must look at the character of the legislation as a whole.\n\n\te.     The provision or statute alleged to contravene the Constitution must be juxtaposed against the provision(s) of the Constitution alleged to be impugned to determine the variance. That is to say, a comparative enquiry must be done to determine whether the statutory provision squared out with the constitutional provision.\n\n\tf.        Finally, within that exercise of seeking to determine the constitutionality of any statutory provision, there was the overarching constitutional obligation to interpret the Constitution itself, in accordance with the constitutional construction imperatives stated in article 259.\n\n\t7.      The obligation on Parliament to enact law to operationalize the removal procedures of governors was stringent and a constitutional necessity. The Act and, in particular, section 33 thereof were intended to operationalize Chapter 11 of the Constitution on Devolution, and article 181 of the Constitution, respectively. The purpose of both the Act and of section 33 therefore have a sound constitutional underpinning, under stringent time demands.\n\n\t8.       The purpose of section 33 of the Act was to give effect to article 181 of the Constitution whose purpose was to foster accountable exercise of power through, inter alia, the removal of unfit public officials who had been elected by the people to govern at the county level. The power of self-governance and participation of the people provided for by article 174 (c) of the Constitution had to be read together with article 1 to the effect that people could also indirectly exercise sovereignty and they did that through electing their representatives at the county level who make decisions on their behalf. To that extent the mandate of impeachment had been placed on the peoples’ representatives. Thus, to the textual approach of interpreting the Constitution, the power of impeachment lay with the County Assembly and the Senate.\n\n\t9.      The effect of section 33 was to ensure that the objectives of article 181 were met in accordance with the Constitution, and to that extent section 33 was intra vires the Constitution.\n\n\t10.  Article 1(2) was to the effect that sovereign power belonged to the people and could be exercised either directly or indirectly. Article 1(3) (a) provided that the peoples’ sovereign power was delegated to, among other state organs, the ‘‘legislative assemblies in the county governments’’. Further, under article 38 of the Constitution the people exercised their sovereignty directly through the political right to vote by electing their representatives through a secret ballot.Reading these provisions together, there could be no doubt that the elected representativesexercised sovereignty on behalf of the people, through the principle of delegation of power to state organs. In that case, the delegation was to the legislative assembly in the county government. There was no requirement for a popular exercise of political right to vote in respect of the removal of a governor.\n\n\t11.  Section 33 was not in any way inconsistent with article 1 of the Constitution. When the county assembly chose to invoke section 33 and to debate the motion on the impeachment of the Governor, and when the Senate followed suit, neither the Embu County Assembly members nor the Senate were acting in contravention of the Constitution, as section 33 was not unconstitutional to that extent.\n\n\t12.  In interpreting article 10 in light of article 259(4)(b), it was implied that the list contained in article 10 was an example from an unexhausted generic categorization of the components of values and principles of good governance.  Therefore, it could not be construed that every aspect provided for under section 33 would, or should, be expected to contain all the unexhausted components listed as national values and principles. What was required was that for a statute or provision to be compliant with article 10, it had to contain a majority of, or fundamentally similar, components of the listed values and principles within the subject matter under consideration in the provision. In addition, it must not contain provisions with components contradictory to those within the generic ambit of those in the national values and principles list.\n\n\t13.  Whether section 33 squared with article 196(1)(b) in respect of the process of removal of a governor; section 33 provided for participation of members of county assemblies and senators. At the Senate there was scope for investigations on the charges levelled against the governor, which could reasonably include inviting witnesses or any other person to appear before it pursuant to the Senate’s powers under article 125 to call for evidence.\n\n\t14.   Article 196(1)(a), and (2) provided that public participation included: holding of county assembly business in an open manner; holding sittings in public and not excluding the public or media from any sitting except in exceptional circumstances. Article 196(3) required Parliament to enact legislation, and such legislation on public participation under the Act was contained in Part VIII, sections 87-92 on Citizen Participation in the Act.\n\n\t15.  Section 87(d) required citizen participation to be based on, inter alia, the principle of affording legal standing to interested or affected persons to appeal from, or review decisions or redress grievances. Section 88(1) provided citizens with the right to petition the county government as follows: ‘‘ Citizens have the right to petition  the county government on any matter under the responsibility of the county government.’’ Those provisions of the Act would both apply to the situation of a governor facing removal where he, or the citizens, desired to participate in the process.\n\n\t16.  A consideration to the nature of public participation constitutionally required in respect of recalling of a member of Parliament and member of County Assembly, as compared to that constitutionally provided for removal of a governor showed that, whereas the people of Kenya provided for removal by recall of a member of Parliament through involving the electorate, the people did not provide a similar requirement for removal of a governor.\n\n\t17.  Article 259 of the Constitution provided that the Constitution shall be interpreted in a manner that promoted its purposes values and principles. As such it had to be read as an integral document. In light of the forgoing, Section 33 of the Act was not contrary to article 196 of the Constitution, as alleged.\n\n\t18.  Looking at what took place prior to the ejection of the Governor, the laid down procedure was followed in his removal. The Law provided several opportunities for a governor to be heard before being removed from office.  Undersection 33 of the Act, where the Senate opts for the formation of a special committee, as was done in the case of the 1st Petitioner, the governor would have an opportunity to be heard by the special committee and another opportunity to be heard by the full House, where removal had been recommended by the special committee.\n\n\t19.    The overriding consideration of the principles of natural justice was that the rules were applicable on a case by case basis.  The underlying foundation of the principles was that in so far as the audi alteram partem rule was concerned, before a decision was taken, the person to be affected by the decision had to be informed of the impending decision or action, notice of the matters to be taken into account against the person should be given, and that person had to be given an opportunity to be heard.  In a serious matter like the one before the court, those rules had to be applied without exception.\n\n\t20.  There was no evidence on record to show that the Speaker manifested bias or that a bystander would have formed the opinion that he was biased.  By accepting the motion, he was only doing that which the law required him to do. The role of the Speaker in the process was therefore statutory.\n\n\t21.   As for the mover of the motion, it is indeed true that he is the one who had moved the initial motion.  There was, however, no law barring him from moving a similar motion the second time. Since the earlier removal had been declared null and void, Section 33(8) of the Act which barred reintroduction of a removal motion on the same grounds within three months was inapplicable.  The motion was therefore properly before the floor of the Assembly and the 2nd Respondent was mandated by the law to preside over the debate of the motion.\n\n\t22.  Under article 177 of the Constitution, the Speaker of the County Assembly was an ex officio member of the Assembly. No nexus had been made between the contempt proceedings which were facing the Speaker and the subsequent motion to impeach the 1st Petitioner. Further the tabling of the motion could not come to the aid of the 2nd Respondent as the matter was already in the hands of the Court and the motion could not have in any way influenced the direction of the contempt of Court proceedings.\n\n\t23.  The issue that all the members of the initial Special Committee were picked to serve in the second Special Committee that was to investigate the allegations against the Governor was debated at length by the Senate and it was decided that there was nothing wrong in allowing the same members to sit in the new Committee. Although there was nothing untoward in the filling of the Special Committee with members who had dealt with the first removal, the decision by the Senate did not give the impression that justice would be seen to have been done. Such course of action in future was not recommended. Human beings were prone to prejudices and biases and any independent observer could easily reach the conclusion that the 1st Petitioner was not treated fairly by being subjected to the same people who had dealt with him before over the same matter.\n\n\t24.   In the circumstances, there ought to have been no difficulty in appointing different members of the Senate to the second Special Committee.  In any case, a special committee was formed as and when the need arose. Under Section 33(6) (a) of the Act a special committee could report that particulars of any allegation against the governor had not been substantiated and that would be the end of the matter. The special committee therefore had a critical role to play in the removal proceedings. The fate of a governor could well depend on the report of the special committee.\n\n\t25.  No prejudice was occasioned to the 1st Petitioner as the report of the Special Committee was adopted by an overwhelming majority of the whole House. The Senate had a fixed membership, save for any vacancies, during its lifetime, and where a matter was supposed to be handled by the House then nobody could be heard to say that the matter ought to have been handled by different people for there could only be one Senate at a time. Nothing however, turned on that issue.\n\n\t26.  Violation of the law and the Constitution by a governor could be remedied, inter alia, through removal or institution of criminal charges.  The people of Kenya had to embrace the doctrine of political responsibility. Those voted into public offices should not be heard to say that theirs was only about policy formulation. They were in charge of the institutions they oversaw and when those institutions fail they could be called upon to explain their role in such failures. Although removal from office was still at its infancy, it was a useful tool for ensuring that governors and public officers in general were accountable to the electorate and the public. Waiting for five years to remove an inept, incompetent, corrupt or unaccountable leader could be disastrous and that was why removal could sometimes be a useful tool in appropriate cases.\n\n\t27.  The right to public participation was based on the democratic idea of popular sovereignty and political equality as enshrined in article 1 of the Constitution. Because the government was derived from the people, all citizens had the right to influence governmental decisions; and the government had to respond to them. Therefore, participation must certainly entail citizens’ direct involvement in the affairs of their community as the people must take part in political affairs.\n\n\t28.  Article 196(1)(b) of the Constitution enjoined a County Assembly to facilitate public participation and involvement in the legislative and other business of the assembly and its committees. Whereas the Constitution did  not expressly task the County Assembly with the role of removal of a Governor, article 181(2) of the Constitution empowered Parliament to enact legislation providing for the procedure of removal of a county governor on the grounds specified under the said article. Pursuant to the said provision Parliament enacted the County Governments Act and in section 33 the procedure for removal of a Governor was to be initiated in the County Assembly. Accordingly, the removal of a governor was one of the businesses statutorily assigned to the County Assembly.\n\n\t29.  The question was not whether the public ought to participate in the process of the removal of a governor but to what extent should that participation go. Some level of public participation had to be injected into the process in order to appreciate the fact that a governor was elected by the County, and in order to avoid situations where an otherwise popular governor was removed from office due to malice, ill will and vendetta on the part of the Members of the County Assemblies.\n\n\t30.  An opportunity had to be availed to the voters in a County to air their views on the process of the removal of their Governor before a decision was arrived at either way. To completely lock out the voters from being heard on such important matter as the removal of their Governor would be contrary to the spirit of article 1(2) of the Constitution. Whereas it was not be possible that each and every person in the County be heard on the issue, those who wished to put across their views on the impeachment ought to be allowed to do so though the ultimate decision rests with the County Assembly.\n\n\t31.  Public participation ought to commence from the time of the notification of the motion to remove the Governor by a member to the Clerk which notification was the mandate of the Assembly. Thatwas when the removal process crystallized. However, it was clear that the period provided between the notification and the time for debating and the determination of the motion by the Assembly in the Standing Orders was very limited. It was therefore not plausible to expect that the mode of public participation in such circumstances would be commensurate with that of the enactment of legislation.\n\n\t32.  In making a determination whether the County Assembly complied with its duty to facilitate public participation, the Court would consider whether what the County Assembly had done was reasonable in all the circumstances. The factors that would determine reasonableness would include the nature of the business conducted by the County Assembly and whether there were timelines to be met as set by the law. That would be the ultimate determination on the method of facilitating public participation.\n\n\t33.  For purposes of the impeachment proceedings, public participation should relate to the impeachment proceedings themselves. It could not be justified on the basis of events that took place before the said proceedings were formally commenced by notice to the Clerk of the Assembly. Therefore the prior processes of investigations of the alleged complaints by the farmers could not constitute public participation for the purposes of the impeachment process.\n\n\t34.  From the averments by the parties which were before the Court, the allegation made by the Petitioners that they were not afforded an opportunity to participate in the removal proceedings had not been proved. The court could not stretch the averments in the supporting affidavit set out to mean that the respondent’s infrastructure stated in paragraph 32 of the replying affidavit was not adhered to in the case. In matters such as the one before the court, evidence was contained in the affidavit rather than in submissions.\n\n\t35.  Although the Standing Orders of the County Assembly of Embu provided for the removal by impeachment, the Constitution and the Act did not mention impeachment in reference to governors.  The two documents only referred to removal from office. A closer look at the Constitution explained why the drafters of the Constitution stuck with the words ‘removal from office’ in the case of governors.\n\n\t36.  There were two provisions in the Constitution for the removal of the President. Under article 144, the President could be removed from office on grounds of incapacity whilst under article 145; he could be removed by impeachment. However, in the case of a governor, the grounds of removal were lumped together under article 181.\n\n\t37.  A person cannot be blamed, accused or prosecuted for being physically or mentally unable to discharge the duties of office hence the avoidance of the word ‘impeach’ in respect of the removal of county governors from office.  That also explained why Parliament provided under section 33(9) of the Act that removal of a governor from office on the grounds of physical or mental incapacity would be done in accordance with article 144 of the Constitution with necessary modifications.  It would hence not be wrong to say that a governor has been removed by impeachment if the removal was not on the ground of physical or mental incapacity to perform the duties of office.\n\n\t38.  The threshold for removal from office of a governor was provided under the Constitution and the Act.  The Senate Standing Orders and the standing orders of various county assemblies made further provision on the issue. Section 33 (1) of the Act provided that to move a motion, it had to be supported by at least a third of all the members of the County Assembly.  Thereafter, during the vote, the motion had to be supported by at least two-thirds of all the members of the County Assembly. At the Senate, section 33 (7) of the Act provided that for removal of a governor to succeed it must be supported by a majority of all members of the Senate.\n\n\t39.   Looking at the applicable laws in various jurisdictions it was clear that other jurisdictions had provided for a more stringent procedure for impeachment.  For example the inclusion of the Chief Justice in the Philippines in the impeachment panel; and the constitution by the Chief Judge of an independent impeachment panel in Nigeria. Ideally, that should be the case as removal from office had the potential to ruin a person’s career and reputation spanning many years. The Kenyan laws appeared to have left that issue entirely in the hands of the politicians – the County Assembly and the Senate. It was judgment by peers.  On account of that, it was imperative that the judiciary exercised greater vigilance in its supervisory role.\n\n\t40.  Black’s Law Dictionary, 9th Edition at page 1619 defined threshold in respect to parliamentary law as “the number or proportion of votes needed for election”. Hence the numbers constituting the threshold for the removal counted for something.\n\n\t41.  Gross violation of the Constitution or any other law was a ground for removal from office as provided under article 181(1) (a). An interpretation of article 181 of the Constitution as read with Section 33 of the County Governments Act showed that removal of a Governor was a constitutional and political process; it was a sui generis process that was quasi-judicial in nature and the rules of natural justice and fair administrative action must be observed.  The impeachment architecture in article 181 of the Constitution revealed that removal of a Governor was not about criminality or culpability but was about accountability, political governance as well as policy and political responsibility.\n\n\t42.  The Court had a supervisory role to play in the process of the removal of a governor. So long as the Constitution remained as it was, the Court had a duty to check the constitutionality and legality of anything done by Parliament (National Assembly and Senate) and the county assemblies. The Court had to zealously and firmly guard that power for to do otherwise would amount to subverting the Constitution by abdicating a clear constitutional responsibility. In the same breath, the courts could not take over the roles clearly reposed in the other arms of government by the Constitution as that would amount to an overthrow of the Constitution in the pretext of exercising supervisory powers. A delicate balance had to be struck in order to attain harmonious and smooth operation of the engine of governance. The Court must not severely restrict the constitutional mandates of the other state organs to the extent that those organs cannot execute their work. Such restrictions could result in the Constitution looking like a green and beautiful tree that bore no fruit.\n\n\t43.  The powers exercisable by the Court were powers of review and such powers could only check compliance with the Constitution, the law, the rules of natural justice and the rationality of impugned decisions.  Where the decision of the impeaching organs was contrary to common logic, then the Court could quash such a decision for being unreasonable.\n\n\t44.  The conduct of the county assemblies and the Senate should only raise the antenna of the Court if they did something perverse to normal conduct to the extent of perplexing and agitating the mind of the ordinary man.\n\n\t45.  There were clear steps provided in the process leading to the removal of a governor. That process begun at the county level then proceeded to the Senate. Where the motion for removal had succeeded in the County Assembly, it did not necessarily mean the Senate would automatically approve the removal.  In fact a careful reading of the relevant laws showed that the actual trial was by the Senate.  Under article 96(1) of the Constitution the role of the Senate was to represent the counties, and protect the interests of the counties and their governments.  In the removal of a governor, the County Assembly and the Senate were performing their functions under the Constitution and the Act.\n\n\t46.  The courts had to be very careful before they intervened in matters that were properly in the domain of other state organs. The courts could only intervene where constitutional issues were raised.\n\n\t47.  The Court had to interrogate the facts in order to determine whether there was nexus between the Governor and the alleged gross violations which would call for a substantive interrogation of the charges and evidence leading to the removal in order for the Court to make any meaningful and legitimate intervention.   However, the court was not supplied with material which would enable it to conduct interrogation, and there was the danger of the Court speculating as to whether what led to removal of the Governor met the threshold. For example, the evidence which was tabled before the investigations committees was not availed to the Court. In addition, evidence such as was availed to the Senate and which was referred to in the Hansard was not availed before the Court. That was the nature of evidence which might have enabled the Court to deal with the issues of nexus and threshold.\n\n\t48.  A perusal of the report showed that the Senate analyzed the evidence put forward in support of each allegation.  The Senate also considered the 1st Petitioner’s written answer to the charges before making its determination. \n\n\t49.  As had been held by the Court of Appeal, the standard of proof required for removal of Governor was above a balance of probability but below reasonable doubt noting that the threshold for removal of a governor involved “gross violation of the Constitution”.  If that be so, then the Senate had attained that standard.\n\n\t50.  It was apparent that the Senate understood the constitutional threshold that had to be met hence there was no reason to fault the Senate in its conclusion. A scrutiny of the Report of the Special Committee on the removal of the 1st Petitioner found the same to be satisfactory. \n\nPetition dismissed each party to bear its costs.\n",

It has not refused to determine questions either of fact or of law so long as it has found itself possessed of power to do it and the cause of justice to be capable of being vindicated by its actions. But, it cannot assume unto itself powers the Constitution lodges elsewhere or undertake tasks entrusted by the Constitution to other departments of State which may be better equipped to perform them. The scrupulously discharged duties of all guardians of the Constitution include the duty not to transgress the limitations of their own constitutionally circumscribed powers by trespassing into what is properly the domain of other constitutional organs. Questions of political wisdom or executive policy only could not be subjected to judicial control. No doubt executive policy must also be subordinated to constitutionally sanctioned purposes. It has its sphere and limitations. But, so long as it operates within that sphere, its operations are immune from judicial interference. This is also a part of the doctrine of a rough separation of powers under the Supremacy of the Constitution repeatedly propounded by this Court and to which the Court unswervingly adheres even when its views differ or change on the correct interpretation of a particular constitutional provision.”",

It is well established that every statute enjoys a presumption of constitutionality and the court is entitled to presume that the legislature acted in a constitutional and fair manner unless the contrary is proved by the petitioner. In considering whether an enactment is unconstitutional, the court must look at the character of the legislation as a whole, its purpose and objects and effect of its provisions (see Ndyanabo v Attorney General of Tanzania (2001) 2 EA 485, Joseph Kimani and Others v Attorney General and Others Mombasa Petition No. 669 of 2009 [2010] eKLR, Murang’a Bar Operators and Another v Minister of State for Provincial Administration and Internal Security and Others Nairobi Petition No. 3 of 2011 (Unreported)), Samuel G.

            "“The power of courts to declare a statute unconstitutional is subject to two guiding principles of decision which ought never to be absent from judicial consciousness. One is that courts are concerned only with the power to enact statutes, not with their wisdom. The other is that while unconstitutional exercise of power by the executive and legislative branches of the government is subject to judicial restraint, the only check upon our own exercise of power is our sense of self-restraint. For the removal of unwise laws from the statute books appeal lies, not to the courts, but to the ballot and to the processes of democratic government.” [Emphasis supplied]",

It is not for the court to examine the merits or demerits of such a policy because its scrutiny has to be limited to the question as to whether the impugned regulations fall within the scope of the regulation…”",
            "“I cannot agree. In my view, both purpose and effect are relevant in determining constitutionality; either unconstitutional purpose or unconstitutional effect can invalidate legislation. All legislation is animated by an object the legislature intends to achieve. This object is realised through the impact produced with the operation and application of the legislation. Purpose and effect respectively, in the sense of the legislation’s objects and its ultimate impact, are clearly linked, if not indivisible. Intended and actual effects have often been looked to for guidance in assessing the legislation’s object and thus, its validity.” (Emphasis added)",
            "“When an Act of Congress is appropriately challenged in the courts as not conforming to the constitutional mandate, the judicial branch of the government has only one duty; to lay the article of the Constitution which is invoked beside the statute which is challenged and to decide whether the latter squares with the former. All the court does, or can do, is to announce its considered judgment upon the question. The only power it has, if such it may be called, is the power of judgment. This court neither approves nor condemns any legislative policy. Its delicate and difficult office is to ascertain and declare whether the legislation is in accordance with, or in contravention of, the provisions of the Constitution; and, having done that, its duty ends.” [Emphasis added]",

There are three sequential steps to be followed: first is initiation of a motion to remove the Governor by a member of the County Assembly; second there is consideration of the motion and a resolution by two thirds of all members of the County Assembly and third, the Speaker of the County Assembly is to forward the County Assembly’s resolution to the Senate for hearing of the charges against the Governor.”",

            "“Our constitutional democracy has essential elements which constitute its foundation; it is partly representative and partly participative. These two elements reflect the basic and fundamental objective of our constitutional democracy. The provisions of the Constitution must be construed in a manner that is compatible with these principles of our democracy. Our system of government requires that the people elect representatives who make laws on their behalf and contemplates that people will be given the opportunity to participate in the law-making process in certain circumstances. The law-making process will then produce a dialogue between the elected representatives of the people and the people themselves. The representative and participative elements of our democracy should not be seen as being in tension with each other…….What our constitutional scheme requires is “the achievement of a balanced relationship between representative and participatory elements in our democracy.” The public involvement provisions of the Constitution address this symbolic relationship, and they lie at the heart of the legislative function. The Constitution contemplates that the people will have a voice in the legislative organs of the State not only through elected representatives but also through participation in the law-making process……To uphold the government’s submission would therefore be contrary to the conception of our democracy, which contemplates an additional and more direct role for the people of the provinces in the functioning of their provincial legislatures than simply through the electoral process. The government’s argument that the provisions of section 118(1)(a) are met by having a proposed constitutional amendment considered only by elected representatives must therefore be rejected…..Before leaving this topic, it is necessary to stress two points. First, the preamble of the Constitution sets as a goal the establishment of “a society based on democratic values [and] social justice” and declares that the Constitution lays down “the foundations for a democratic and open society in which government is based on the will of the people.” The founding values of our constitutional democracy include human dignity and “a multi-party system of democratic government to ensure accountability, responsiveness and openness.”  And it is apparent from the provisions of the Constitution that the democratic government that is contemplated is partly representative and partly participatory, accountable, transparent and makes provision for public participation in the making of laws by legislative bodies. Consistent with our constitutional commitment to human dignity and self respect, section 118(1)(a) contemplates that members of the public will often be given an opportunity to participate in the making of laws that affect them. As has been observed, a “commitment to a right to . . . public participation in governmental decision-making is derived not only from the belief that we improve the accuracy of decisions when we allow people to present their side of the story, but also from our sense that participation is necessary to preserve human dignity and self respect.”",
            "“…engagement with the public is essential. Public participation informs the public of what is to be expected. It allows for the community to express concerns, fears and even to make demands. In any democratic state, participation is integral to its legitimacy. When a decision is made without consulting the public the result can never be an informed decision. As this Court observed in Doctors for Life, both the duty to facilitate public involvement and the positive right to political participation “seek to ensure that citizens have the necessary information and the effective opportunity to exercise the right to political participation.” This can be achieved not only through elected representatives, but also by enabling citizens to participate directly in public affairs, “through public debate and dialogue with elected representatives, referendums and popular initiatives or through self-organisation”.",
            "“The right to political participation is a fundamental human right, which is set out in a number of international and regional human rights instruments.  In most of these instruments, the right consists of at least two elements; a general right to take part in the conduct of public affairs; and a more specific right to vote and/or to be elected ….Significantly, the ICCPR guarantees not only the “right” but also the “opportunity” to take part in the conduct of public affairs,  This imposes an obligation on states to take positive steps to ensure that their citizens have an opportunity to exercise their right to political participation….The right to political participation includes but is not limited to the right to vote in an election.  That right, which is specified in Article 25(b) of the ICCPR, represents one institutionalization of the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs.  The broader right, which is provided for in Article 25(a), envisages forms of political participation which are not limited to participation in the electoral process.  It is now generally accepted that modes of participation may include not only indirect participation through elected representatives but also forms of direct participation……”",
            "“The forms of facilitating an appropriate degree of participation in the law-making process are indeed capable of infinite variation. What matters is that at the end of the day a reasonable opportunity is offered to members of the public and all interested parties to know about the issue and to have an adequate say. What amounts to a reasonable opportunity will depend on the circumstances of each case.” [Emphasis supplied]",
            "“Parliament and the provincial legislatures must be given a significant measure of discretion in determining how best to fulfil their duty to facilitate public involvement. This discretion will apply both in relation to the standard rules promulgated for public participation and the particular modalities appropriate for specific legislative programmes”. ",
            "“In my view public participation ought to be real and not illusory and ought not to be treated as a mere formality for the purposes of fulfilment of the Constitutional dictates. It is my view that it behoves the County Assemblies in enacting legislation to ensure that the spirit of public participation is attained both quantitatively and qualitatively.”",
            "“It seems that ‘consultation’ in its normal sense without reference to the context in which it is used, denotes a deliberate getting together of more than one person or party…in a situation of conferring with each other where minds are applied to weigh and consider together the pros and cons of a matter by discussion or debate. The word consultation in itself does not presuppose or suggest a particular forum, procedure or duration for such discussion or debate. Nor does it imply that any particular formalities should be complied with. Nor does it draw any distinction between communications conveyed orally or in writing. What it does suggest is a communication of ideas on a reciprocal basis.”",
            "“…It is not just enough in my view to simply “tweet” messages as it were and leave it to those who care to scavenge for it. The County Assemblies ought to do whatever is reasonable to ensure that as many of their constituents in particular and the Kenyans in general are aware of the intention to pass legislation and where the legislation in question involves such important aspect as payment of taxes and levies, the duty is even more onerous. I hold that it is the duty of the County Assembly in such circumstances to exhort its constituents to participate in the process of the enactment of such legislation by making use of as may fora as possible such as churches, mosques, temples, public barazas national and vernacular radio broadcasting stations and other avenues where the public are known to converge to disseminate information with respect to the intended action.”",
            "“The phrase “facilitate public involvement” is a broad concept, which relates to the duty to ensure public participation in the law-making process. The key words in this phrase are “facilitate” and “involvement”. To “facilitate” means to “make easy or easier”, “promote” or “help forward”. The phrase “public involvement” is commonly used to describe the process of allowing the public to participate in the decision-making process. The dictionary definition of “involve” includes to “bring a person into a matter” while participation is defined as “[a] taking part with others (in an action or matter); . . . the active involvement of members of a community or organization in decisions which affect them”. According to their plain and ordinary meaning, the words public involvement or public participation refer to the process by which the public participates in something. Facilitation of public involvement in the legislative process, therefore, means taking steps to ensure that the public participate in the legislative process. That is the plain meaning of section 72(1)(a). This construction of section 72(1)(a) is consistent with the participative nature of our democracy. As this Court held in New Clicks, “[t]he Constitution calls for open and transparent government, and requires public participation in the making of laws by Parliament and deliberative legislative assemblies.” The democratic government that is contemplated in the Constitution is thus a representative and participatory democracy which is accountable, responsive and transparent and which makes provision for the public to participate in the law-making process.”",

Section 188 cannot be invoked merely because the House does not like the face or look of the Governor or Deputy Governor in a particular moment or the Governor or Deputy Governor refused to respond with a generous smile to the Legislature qua House on a parliamentary or courtesy visit to the holder of the office. The point I am struggling to make out of this light statement on a playful side is that section 188 is a very strong political weapon at the disposal of the House which must be used only in appropriate cases of serious wrong doing on the part of the Governor or Deputy Governor, which is tantamount to gross misconduct within the meaning of subsection (11). Section 188 is not a weapon available to the Legislature to police a Governor or Deputy Governor in every wrong doing. A Governor or Deputy Governor, as a human being, cannot always be right and he cannot claim to be right always. That explains why section 188 talks about gross misconduct. Accordingly, where a misconduct is not gross, the section 188 weapon of removal is not available to the House of Assembly.”",

            "“It is incumbent upon the High Court to determine if the facts in support of the charges against a Governor meet and prove threshold in Article 181 of the Constitution.  For example, was the 4th appellant an employee of the 1st appellant or of the County Government? Is a Governor to bear personal vicarious liability for the acts and omissions of officers of the County Government?  We are of the view that Article 181 and Section 33 of the County Governments Act are not ouster clauses that limit or oust the jurisdiction of the High Court as conferred by Article 165 (3) (d) (ii) and(iii) of the Constitution.  Though the process of removal of a governor from office is both a constitutional and a political process, the political question doctrine cannot operate to oust the jurisdiction vested on the High Court to interpret the Constitution or to determine the question if anything said to be done under the authority of the Constitution or of any law is consistent with or in contravention of the Constitution.”",
            "“One can, nevertheless, envision different and unusual circumstances that might justify a more searching review of impeachment proceedings.  If the Senate were to act in a manner seriously threatening the integrity of its results, convicting, say, upon a coin toss, or upon a summary determination that an officer of the United States was simply “ ‘a bad guy’”…judicial interference might well be appropriate.  In such circumstances, the Senate’s action might be so far beyond the scope of its constitutional authority, and the consequent impact on the Republic so great, as to merit a judicial response despite the prudential concerns that would ordinarily counsel silence.”",
            "    Can the courts intervene? ",
            "‘….it is true that if a question brought before the Court is purely a political question not involving determination of any legal or constitutional right or obligation, the Court would not entertain it, since the Court is concerned only with adjudication of legal rights and liabilities. But merely because a question has a political complexion that by itself is no ground why the Court should shrink from performing its duty under the Constitution if it raises an issue of constitutional determination. Every constitutional question concerns the allocation and exercise of governmental power and no constitutional question can, therefore, fail to be political. A constitution is a matter of purest politics, a structure of power and as pointed out by Charles Black in Perspectives in Constitutional law' \"constitutional law' symbolizes an intersection of law and politics, wherein issues of political power are acted on by persons trained in the legal tradition, working in judicial institutions, following the procedures of law….\"",
            "\"We [also] reiterate that a court reviewing the procedure of a legislature is not a super-legislature, sitting on appeal on the wisdom, correctness or desirability of the opinion of the impugned decision-making organ. It has neither the mandate nor the institutional equipment for that purpose in our constitutional design. Moreover, the process cannot be wrong simply because another institution, for example the courts, would have conducted it differently.  It must be accepted that the institutional environment is controlling on the manner in which an organ disposes of its issues.”",
            "“CONCLUSION",
            "153. The Special Committee, having executed its mandate under section 33 of the County Governments Act and standing order 68 of the Senate Standing Orders has found as follows-",
            "(1) On the Charge of Gross Violation of the Public Procurement and Disposal Act, Chapter 412A of the Laws of Kenya, pursuant to section 33(6) of the County Governments Act, 2012 and standing order 68(4) of the Senate Standing Orders, the Committee finds this Charge to be substantiated; ",
            "(2) On the Charge of Gross Violation of the Public Finance Management Act, Chapter 412 C of the Laws of Kenya, pursuant to section 33(6) of the County Governments Act, 2012 and standing order 68(4) of the Senate Standing Orders, the Committee finds this Charge to be substantiated; and",
            "(3) On the Charge of Gross Violation of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 pursuant to section 33(6) of the County Governments Act, 2012 and standing order 68(4) of the Senate Standing Orders, the Committee finds this Charge to be substantiated.”",
            "“99. The Governor, in his response, seems to have taken the approach of denying liability and assigning blame to other officials within the County, specially the procurement officials, arguing that procurement was not undertaken by the Governor but by these officials.  On the lack of germination of seeds, the Governor, in his response, blamed “lack of adequate rainfall or other non-procurement reasons”. This, however, is not corroborated by the documentation from the experts - KEPHIS and the County Executive Committee Member for Agriculture – which make no mention of lack of adequate rainfall as a factor that may have contributed to the non-germination or poor germination of the DK 8031 maize seeds.",
            "100.  Article 179(4) of the Constitution provides that the Governor is the “chief executive” of the County.   Where the entire County is virtually at a stand-still due to a failed crop, and the County Executive is virtually on trial by the residents of Embu County, it is unthinkable that the chief executive of the County would do nothing except to shift blame to junior officers in the County and to blame, without any proof, lack of adequate rainfall as the cause of the failed crop.  As chief executive, the Governor retains an overall oversight responsibility over the affairs of his County, including matters of procurement, and he cannot therefore be heard to say, on a matter so important to the County as the distribution of failed maize seeds that “it was not me”.",
            "101.  Article 227 of the Constitution provides for “procurement of goods and services” and requires, at sub-article (1) that “when a State organ or any other public entity contracts for goods and services, it shall do so in accordance with a system that is fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and cost-effective”.  In this matter, the Special Committee observes that there is no evidence that the procurement of the maize seeds was conducted in a fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and cost-effective manner.  The evidence of the County Assembly and that of the County Executive Committee for Agriculture points to procurement of DK 8031 maize seed which was authorized  by the Office of the Governor but that fell below the threshold under article 227 of the Constitution.  The County Assembly in making its case stated that the entire procurement of the maize seeds demonstrated “complacency, incompetence and manipulation of the procurement system to aid fraud”.  This position was not rebutted by the response of the Governor which merely sought to place blame on the procurement officials.",
            "102.  Section 27 of the Public Procurement and Disposal Act, 2005, further requires at sub-section (3) that “each employee of a public entity and each member of a board or committee of the public entity shall ensure, within the areas of responsibility of the employee or member that this Act, the regulations and the directions of the Authority are complied with”. No evidence was presented by the Governor to demonstrate that, as the chief executive of the County Executive, he had ensured compliance with the Public Procurement and Disposal Act, 2005 before taking the steps of launching the DK 8031 maize seeds and extensively distributing the maize seeds within the County.  There was also no evidence that the Governor had directed the County Secretary or the officials serving in his office to adhere to the procurement laws.  Had the Governor done so, he would probably have forestalled the massive losses occasioned to the farmers.",
            "103.  The Committee further observed, as had been submitted by the County Assembly, that the annual procurement plan of the Director of Agriculture prepared in accordance with section 26(3) of the Public Procurement and Disposal Act, provided for the purchase of two varieties of maize: KDV 1 and KDV 6.  The County Executive, with the authorization and full knowledge of the Office of the Governor, proceeded to instead purchase maize of variety DK 8031 without the authority of the Tender Committee as required under section 26(4) of the Public Procurement and Disposal Act and in accordance with the procurement procedure detailed under section 34 of the Act.”",
            "“143. As the chief executive of the County, the Governor had a responsibility to ensure that he discharged the obligation under section 162 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2012 with respect to the management and utilization of County resources.   The response of the Governor to the allegations set out by the County Assembly does not demonstrate to the Committee that the Governor has indeed discharged his mandate under section 162 of the Public Procurement and Disposal Act, 2012.”",
            "“150. The Special Committee further observed that the standard response by the Governor to all the allegations set out by the County Assembly has been “it was not me”.  This response by the Governor does little to “promote public confidence” in the office of the Governor as required under Article 73(1)(a)(iv) of the Constitution.  The Governor seems to have abdicated from taking any responsibility for the goings on in his office and in his County, despite being the elected chief executive of the County.  This is in violation of section (sic) 73(2)(d) of the Constitution which requires that State officers be guided by the principle of “accountability to the public for decisions and actions”.",
            " “….neither beyond reasonable doubt nor on a balance of probability.  Noting that the threshold for removal of a governor involves “gross violation of the Constitution”, we hold that the standard of proof required for removal of Governor is above a balance of probability but below reasonable doubt.”",
            "\tIf that be so, then we do not hesitate to hold that the Senate attained this standard.",
            "“75. These are therefore the standards by which the Governor should be judged when considering the allegations against him and the evidence produced in support of the allegations.  The violations must be gross, that is, a glaring error, flagrant and extreme.   The violation must be such that it brings dishonour and lowers the dignity of the office of the governor.  A minor infraction of the law cannot attract the sanction of impeachment.” ",

            "The Minister for Labour, in exercise of the powers conferred upon him by Section 8 of the Trade Disputes Act, Cap.234, Laws of Kenya (which is hereinafter referred to as the Act) referred this dispute to the Court on 22nd September 1999 for adjudication and determination; and his reference, together with the statutory certificate from the Labour Commissioner under Section 14, subsection (9)(e) of the Act, were received by the Court on 28th September 1999. The 2nd Union submitted their memorandum on 3rd March 2000; and the dispute was heard ex-parte on 8th June 2000, in default of appearance and reply statement by the 1st Union. On 9th June 2000, the Secretary General of the 1st Union wrote to me that he was unable to attend or appear before the Court on 8th June 2000 due to oversight of the hearing date and also prayed that the ex-parte hearing be vacated and the case should be heard inter-partes. On 12th June 2000, the said Secretary General wrote to me again wherein he regretted the 1st Union’s inability, due to financial constraints, to increase the employees’ wages or salaries and other benefits beyond the increments which were awarded to them on 1st September 1996. They (1st Union) also filed a statement of their inability on 26th June 2000. In the circumstances, I advised the parties to negotiate and explore the possibility of an amicable settlement. The parties were, however, unable to compromise due to the intransigent and recalcitrant attitude of the Secretary General of the 2nd Union. Accordingly, the application by the 1st Union to be allowed to defend the case on merits was heard on 18th September 2000.",
            "In his brief submission, Mr. Kanani reiterated the 1st Union’s inability as stated hereinabove on the ground that they (Union) were financially just drudging along on their way. He, therefore, urged the Court to vacate the ex-parte hearing and invoke its inherent and discretionary powers by hearing the case de novo inter-partes.",
            "In reply, Mr. Otieno strenuously resisted the demand to re-open the matter on the ground that the 1st Union acted in bad faith by deliberately failing to attend the Court during the hearing of this dispute, thus occasioning the ex-parte hearing of the case. In any case, he said, the Court has no power to review the ex-parte hearing and prayed that the ex-parte award be delivered.",
            "I have carefully gone through the submission of the parties and appreciate the anxiety of the 2nd Union that the matter should be expeditiously disposed of and as conveniently as possible. But whether the 1st Union had acted in bad faith or mala fide in failing to attend Court on 8th June 2000 is a question of fact and it would depend upon the evidence and circumstances of the case.  In my opinion, I find that the 1st Union did not act in bad faith when they failed to attend Court on the said date. This was purely an oversight on their part, and for this reason I set aside or vacate the ex-parte hearing and order that this dispute be heard or proceed de novo inter-partes.",

Aggrieved by the decision to declare the 3rd Respondent as winner, the Petitioner filed the instant Petition on the grounds that the counting and tallying process was characterised by irregularities among other grounds.\n\n\tAt the end of the oral hearing, the Petitioner filed an application seeking scrutiny and recount of the ballots cast in the gubernatorial election. The Court allowed the Application for a partial scrutiny limited to recount of ballots in specified polling stations and a re-tally of the relevant forms. The 3rd Respondent also filed an application seeking a tally of all forms 37A and 37B for all the polling stations in Embu County.  The Court extended recount of ballots to six polling stations and directed the Deputy Registrar of the Court to carry out a re-tally exercise of forms 37A, 37B and 37C in respect of the polling stations that were not going to be subjected to recount.\n\n\t After the exercise the 3rd Respondent emerged as the winner and the Deputy Registrar compiled a report which was subsequently filed in court together with, the original forms used in the partial scrutiny, duly filled by hand and signed by the agents of all the parties and by the Deputy Registrar.\n\nIssues:\n\n\n\t\tWhether an election court could determine an issue which was not pleaded in the Pleadings.\n\n\t\tWhat were the approaches available to an election court to unpleaded material unearthed after recount and scrutiny of votes?\n\n\t\tWhen would non-compliance with electoral laws lead to nullification of an election?\n\n\t\tUnder what circumstances would a court order for scrutiny and recount of votes?\n\n\n\t \n\nRelevant Provisions of the Law:\n\nConstitution of Kenya, 2010\n\nArticle 81- General principles for the electoral system.\n\nThe electoral system shall comply with the following principles—\n\n\nfreedom of citizens to exercise their political rights under Article 38; \n\nnot more than two-thirds of the members of elective public bodies shall be of the same gender;\n\nfair representation of persons with disabilities;\n\nuniversal suffrage based on the aspiration for fair representation and equality of vote; and\n\nfree and fair elections, which are—\n\n\nby secret ballot;\n\nfree from violence, intimidation, improper influence or corruption; \n\nconducted by an independent body; \n\ntransparent; and\n\nadministered in an impartial, neutral, efficient, accurate and accountable manner.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 86 - Voting.\n\nAt every election, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission shall ensure that—\n\n\nwhatever voting method is used, the system is simple, accurate, verifiable, secure, accountable and transparent;\n\nthe votes cast are counted, tabulated and the results announced promptly by the presiding officer at each polling station;\n\nthe results from the polling stations are openly and accurately collated and promptly announced by the returning officer; and\n\nappropriate structures and mechanisms to eliminate electoral malpractice are put in place, including the safekeeping of election materials.\n\n\nElections Act, 2011\n\nSection 83 - Nullification of an election\n\n\nA Court shall not declare an election void for non-compliance with any written law relating to that election if it appears that —\n\n\n\nthe election was conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Constitution and in that written law; and\n\nthe non-compliance did not substantially affect the result of the election.\n\n\n\nPursuant to section 72 of the Interpretation and General Provisions Act, (Cap. 2), a form prescribed by this Act or the regulations made thereunder shall not be void by reason of a deviation from the requirements of that form, as long as the deviation is not calculated to mislead.\n\n\nElections (General) Regulation 2012\n\nRegulation 81 - Sealing of ballot papers by presiding officer\n\n\nUpon completion of a count, including a recount, the presiding officer shall seal in each respective ballot box–\n\n\nvalid votes,\n\nrejected ballots sealed in  a tamperproof envelope,\n\nunused ballot papers sealed in a tamperproof envelope,\n\ncounterfoil of used ballot papers sealed in a tamperproof envelope,\n\ncopy of election results declaration forms, and \n\nstray ballot papers in a tamperproof envelope.\n\n\n\n\nHeld:\n\n\n\t\tThe only way to raise issues before a court was through pleadings and that has always been the legal position. All the rules of pleadings and procedure were designed to crystalize the issue which the Court was to be called upon to determine and the parties were themselves made aware well in advance as what the issues between them were.\n\n\t\tThe Court would not grant a remedy, which had not been applied for and that it would not determine issues which the parties had not pleaded. In an adversarial system, parties to litigation were the ones who set the agenda and subject to rules of pleadings, each party was left to formulate its own case in its own way. It was for the purpose of certainty and finality that each party was bound by its own pleadings. A party could not be allowed to raise a different case from that which it had pleaded without due amendment being made, that was the position in civil matters.\n\n\t\tThe issue of counterfoils was not pleaded in the Petition and the 1st Respondent did not have an opportunity to address it during trial. It could therefore amount to an ambush to deal with it. However, it had to be noted that the instant proceedings were sui generis. They were civil by nature but subject to their unique procedures.\n\n\t\tIt would appear that the legal position could be different with respect to electoral disputes. The general principle is that courts should proceed with caution with respect to material that could be unearthed during scrutiny and recount, for scrutiny and recount were not designed to discover new evidence or unpleaded matters that could found basis for nullification of an election\n\n\t\tThe law on scrutiny and recount suggested that scrutiny and recount was not a gambling exercise that set the Court to rummaging through the ballot boxes to see whether any scintilla of evidence of electoral malpractice or irregularity could be found. If the Petition was based on any particular electoral malpractice or irregularity that would warrant scrutiny or recount of votes, the malpractice or irregularity had to be pleaded  and the evidence of such malpractice or irregularity laid out or established prior to an order for scrutiny or recount. The Court had to be satisfied that on the basis of the evidence before it, it was necessary to call for a scrutiny and recount, if not for anything else, to confirm the truth of the particular evidence.\n\n\t\tThere were three possible approaches to unpleaded material unearthed after recount and scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\t\tThe Court could ignore such material and proceed to dismiss the Petition if the Petitioner failed to prove the allegations made in his pleadings.\n\n\t\tA party was at liberty to pose questions on such unpleaded materials and the Court could make findings on the effect of such irregularities on the declared results.\n\n\t\tThe Court ought not to have turned a blind eye on serious electoral malpractices or irregularities as could be exposed by scrutiny or recount merely because they were not pleaded. \n\n\n\n\t\tAn electoral court could look at the material that emerged from a scrutiny or recount and which was unpleaded and make a decision one way or the other with respect to the same. A court was not precluded from studying the materials merely because the same was not pleaded. Whether the same influenced the direction the matter took depended on the nature of the unpleaded material and the extent that it affected the final outcome.\n\n\t\tThe forms that the Deputy Registrar designed for the purpose of the partial scrutiny were his working notes and the material in them was what was used to generate his report.  The forms formed part of the proceedings. The matters recorded in the notes of the Deputy Registrar were no doubt an indication that there were irregularities in the counting exercise.\n\n\t\tThe import of section 83 of the Elections Act was that as a general rule, the Court should not interfere with results where irregularities or non-compliance with the law was established so long as the election appeared to have been conducted in accordance with the Constitution and the law and the non-compliance did not affect the result.\n\n\t\tAn election had to be conducted substantially in accordance with the principles of the Constitution as set out in article 81 of the Constitution. Voting was to be conducted in accordance with the principles set out in article 86 of the Constitution. The Elections Act and the Regulations thereunder constituted the substantive and procedural law for the conduct of elections. If it was shown that an election was conducted substantially in accordance with the principles of the Constitution and the Elections Act, then such election was not to be invalidated only on the grounds of irregularities. Where, however, it was shown that the irregularities were of such magnitude that they affected the election result, then such an election stood to be invalidated.\n\n\t\tProcedural or administrative irregularities and other errors occasioned by human imperfection were not enough by and of themselves to vitiate an election. Where an election was conducted in such manner as demonestrably violated the principles of the Constitution and the law, such an election stood to be invalidated.\n\n\t\tA petitioner who was able to satisfactorily prove either of the two limbs of section 83 of the Elections Act could void an election. In other words a petitioner who was able to prove that the conduct of the election in question substantially violated the principles laid down in the Constitution as well as other written law on elections , would on that ground alone, void an election. He would be able to void an election if he was able to prove that although the election was conducted substantially in accordance with the principles laid down in the Constitution as well as other written law on elections, it was fraught with irregularities or illegalities that affected the result of the election.\n\n\t\t It could not be said that the first phase of the election was conducted so badly that there was really no election at all. However, it emerged from the material generated by the scrutiny that there were irregularities or non-compliance with the law on elections.\n\n\t\tThe irregularities identified related to material that ought to have been found in the ballot boxes during recount. Regulation 81(1) of the Elections (General) Regulation 2012(the Regulations) was in mandatory terms. The effect of non-compliance with it would depend on the impact of the non-compliance on the total result.\n\n\t\tThe first non-compliance related to failure to put and seal in the ballot boxes all the ballot papers used in the election, whether valid or rejected, contrary to regulation 81 of the Regulations. The record filed by the Deputy Registrar of the forms used during the partial scrutiny revealed that varying numbers of ballots in 184 polling stations were unaccounted for. The number of such ballots was 566. That was a case where the ballots actually cast were less than the total number of counterfoils of used ballot papers. It could not be ascertained as to whether they were spoilt, rejected or valid and if valid in whose favour they were cast.\n\n\t\tThe second non-compliance related to omission to put and seal counterfoils of used ballot papers in the ballot boxes contrary to regulation 81(1) of the Regulations. The record of the forms used by the Deputy Registrar during the recount revealed that in 11 polling stations the counterfoils of the used ballot papers were missing, or, put differently, were not found in the respective ballot boxes. It could not be ascertained therefore how many ballot papers were issued to electors and used, it therefore meant that the results could not be ascertained and verified. the ballot papers in the relevant ballot boxes were recounted against the record in forms 37A for the relevant polling stations but the accuracy of the record in forms 37A could not be ascertained without the counterfoils of the ballots used in those polling stations.\n\n\t\t The third non-compliance was with respect to form 37A. The handwritten record of the forms that the Deputy Registrar prepared for the scrutiny and disclosed that in 12 polling stations there were no forms 37A in the ballot boxes and in 12 other polling stations copies of the forms 37A found in the boxes were totally illegible. Form 37A was a critical document for the purpose of collation, tallying and declaration of results. Without the form or even where the same has been rendered useless by illegibility, there could not be any results to declare as it was the document which authenticated the results. That effectively meant that the results of the election in the 26 polling stations had not been authenticated and validated.\n\n\t\tExcess votes were ballot papers found in the ballot boxes  during recount which were not issued out of the ballot booklets for the relevant polling stations for they could not be traced to the counterfoils of used ballot papers found in the ballot boxes. Such ballot papers in varying numbers were found in 12 ballot boxes from the record of the Deputy Registrars handwritten forms.  The total excess ballot papers cast amounted to 111. That was an irregularity that seriously undermined the electoral process as it suggested that those materials were introduced into the ballot boxes unprocedurally. The effect was to defeat or subvert and distort the will of the people. The excess votes were not authentic and should not have been in the system. Such ballots could only have gotten in through an illegal process and an outcome which was arrived at with such votes being taken into account could not be said to have been fair, accurate, authentic or verifiable.\n\n\t\t. Elections were about electors expressing their will at the voting booth as to who should lead them. Compiling the total results while excluding the votes of the electors in the affected polling stations amounted to disenfranchising them, something that the Court could not countenance.\n\n\t\tThe scrutiny and recount exercise was designed to determine whether the results of the election were accurate, verifiable and accountable and if it produced material that was not in the pleadings the Court could not ignore the same but had to look at it in the wider interests of electoral justice.\n\n\t\tAccording to the Report of the Deputy Registrar, the final tally of the results showed that the difference between the votes garnered by the Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent was between 700 and 800 votes. The non-compliance with regard to the unaccounted ballots affected ballots in the region of 566 votes while that relating to missing counterfoils affected ballots in the region of 4,000 votes while those relating to missing or illegible forms 37A were in excess of 10,000 votes. The excess votes amounted to 111 votes. Looking at all those figures globally there was no doubt that the irregularities affected the final results of the election.\n\n\t\t The irregularities or errors or non-compliance with the law during the collating, counting and tallying of votes in the gubernatorial election held for Embu County on August 8, 2017 undermined the electoral process fundamentally and produced a result that could not be said to be accountable, verifiable or accurate. Consequently, it could not be said to reflect the will of the people of Embu County. It had not been established that the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents were complicit in any way to the non-compliance and the irregularities identified which appeared to have been caused either by fatigue or incompetence on the part of the elections staff hired by the 1st Respondent.\n\n\n\t \n\nPetition allowed\n\n\nThe results of the election held on August 8, 2017 nullified and a fresh gubernatorial election for Embu County ordered.\n\nCosts capped at Kshs. 3,000,000 subject to taxation awarded to the Petitioner to be borne by the 1st Respondent in the sum of Kshs. 2,000,000 and the 3rd and 4th Respondents at Kshs 1,000,000.\n\nA certificate to issue to the 1st Respondent and the Speaker of Senate pursuant to section 86 of the Elections Act.\n\n",

            "\t1. The petition herein was filed on 25th August 2017 by Lenny Maxwell Kivuti, herein after referred to as the petitioner, to challenge the declaration of Martin Nyaga Wambora, hereafter referred to as the 3rd respondent, as the Governor of Embu County in the general elections conducted on 8th August 2017. The other persons named as respondents in the petition are the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (1st respondent), the Embu County Returning Officer (2nd respondent) and David Kariuki (4th respondent). The results declared were –",
            "\t(a) Cyrus Njiru - 2352",
            "\t(b) Kiragu Kithinji – 50440",
            "\t(c) Lenny Maxwell Kivuti -  96775",

            "\t(f) Peter Njagi Njuki – 981.",
            "\t2. The petitioner avers that the process of casting of ballots in respect of the gubernatorial election in Embu County on 8th August 2017 was smooth and peaceful, but alleges that the counting and tallying process was characterised by such irregularities as inflating of results in favour of the 3rd respondent, swapping of lower results for the 3rd respondent with the petitioner’s or the other candidates, submission of doctored or fraudulent results, tampering with Forms 37A at the tallying centres to reflect fictitious figures, submission of Forms 37A which had not been signed by agents, the barring of his agents from participating in the counting and tallying of ballots at polling stations, among others. It is pleaded that the counting of the votes was undertaken in a manner that contravened section 38A of the Elections Act, regulation 69(2) of the Election (General) Regulations 2012 and Article 81 of the Constitution. The petition seeks four principal prayers:  a re-tally of the votes cast in two polling stations within Mbeere South Constituency, scrutiny and recount of all the votes cast within Manyatta and Runyenjes Constituencies with particular emphasis on the polling stations mentioned in the prayer, nullification of the results declared and a declaration that the petitioner was the validly elected Governor of Embu County.",
            "\t3. The 1st and 2nd respondents filed a joint response to the petition, dated 11th September 2017. They deny the allegations made in the petition, and assert that they conducted the gubernatorial election for Embu County in accordance with the relevant law. The 3rd and 4th respondents, in their separate responses to the petition, dated 26th September 2017, assert that the election was conducted in a free and transparent manner, and that they were validly declared as victors after the proper counting of the votes.",
            "\t4. The oral hearing commenced on 23rd November 2017. The petitioner was the first on the stand. He asserted that he won the gubernatorial elections held on 8th August 2017 and believed that his election was stolen. He stated that he had no problem with the voting process as he believed that the same went smoothly, but the counting of votes and the tallying thereof were erroneous in a gross way. He said that the totals announced by the 2nd respondent exceeded the number of registered voters by far. For instance in respect of Runyenjes Constituency, he said the total votes cast as announced were 129, 652 while the registered voters were only 86 977, meaning that the total votes cast exceeded the registered voters by 42 675. He also testified that the 2nd respondent announced that the total votes cast in Manyatta Constituency in the gubernatorial election were 105 700, yet the registered voters stood at 99, 339, meaning that there was a difference of 6 361 votes. He also stated discrepancies between the figures appearing on the portal and those announced by the 2nd respondent. The portal allegedly showed the 3rd respondent leading with 97 544 votes with the petitioner following with 96 597, as against the figures of 97 760 and 96 775, for the 3rd respondent and the petitioner respectively, announced by the 2nd respondent. He also cited discrepancies in Forms 37A and 37B, as between what was announced and what was recorded in polling stations. He said he saw presiding officers altering Forms 37As at Kangaru School. He also stated that the total votes cast for Governor exceeded those cast for Woman Member of Parliament and for Senator. He put the difference between the total votes for Governor and Woman Member of Parliament at 10 638. He testified that many Forms 37As were not stamped. He asserted that if the court allowed a recount of the votes he would emerge victorious. He stated that he had done his own tally which indicated that he would win with 97, 286 votes followed by the 3rd respondent with 96 717 votes. He urged the court to allow recount so as to get the actual totals. He stated that he wanted a scrutiny to establish the state of the electoral materials and thereafter a recount to get the actual totals. He said the truth lay with the ballots in the tamper proof envelopes. He said that he believed that 426 polling stations were affected. He stated that all the evidence that he placed before the court was geared to seeking recount to get to the truth of the votes cast and the correct results. He said that to the best of his knowledge, he had won the election, but his victory was taken away on account of errors, and that he was asking for a recount, verification and re-tallying of the votes and a declaration by the court of the results.",
            "\t5. The other aspect of the petitioner’s evidence touched on his agents. He testified that his agents went through enormous pressure and intimidation between 8th August 2017, that is the day of the actual voting, and 11th August 2017, the day of declaration of results. He asserted that he and his agents were subjected to a lot of discrimination, particularly by being denied copies of Forms 37A. He said that in many polling stations, his agents were denied a chance to sign Form 37A, yet the 3rd respondent’s agents would be allowed or even only one agent would be allowed to sign. He stated that he wrote to the returning officer for Manyatta Constituency, after it proved difficult to talk to her, to request for copies of Forms 37A, but she declined to receive the letter and was told by her to go to court if he was aggrieved. He also said that his chief agent for Manyatta Constituency tried to sign Form 37B but he was denied the opportunity as the form was grabbed from his hand. He also stated that some of the forms were signed by persons who purported to be his agents, yet they were not. He said that he had a list of genuine agents. He asserted that the ‘fake’ agents were meant to authenticate ‘fake’ Forms 37A. He stated that it was his agents who furnished him with copies of the unsigned Forms 37A attached to his petition, as well as those signed by one agent and those signed by the ‘fake’ agents. He stated that he had given his agents notes where they recorded the results as announced by the presiding officers.",
            "\t6. The witness then went through the Forms 37A to point out the polling stations which had issues. He pointed out, for example, polling stations where he said the same returned similar results, suggesting that there was manipulation of the results. Those cited included Karau Primary School, Embu Urban Primary School, Munyori Primary School, among others. He asserted that statistics do not work that way and that that was evidence of doctoring of the results, and said that it was on that basis that he sought recount to establish the truth. He also pointed out the polling stations where he said the relevant forms had not been signed. These included Kareri Primary School, Githagare Primary School, Ndatu Catholic Church grounds, Thikima Coffee Factory, Kauga Tea Buying Centre, Itabua Primary School, among others. He stated that the significance of the unsigning of the forms was that the results were not authenticated and he wanted recount and re-tally so as to remedy the situation. He also pointed at polling stations where he allegedly lost votes and where the 3rd respondent was given votes he had not earned. These included Githunguriri Tea Buying Centre, Embu County Primary School, Gategi Primary School, Karau Primary School, Embu Municipal Stadium, St Andrews Primary School, Mikimbi Full Gospel Church grounds.  He asserted that the total effect of the errors in Forms 37A and 37B was that his votes would increase by 817 votes and the 3rd respondent’s votes would reduce by 615 votes, reducing the margin between them to 168 votes. He stated that there were votes recorded by his agents that were not reflected in Forms 37A and if those were taken into account he would be ahead of the 3rd respondent by 569 votes. He also pointed out polling stations where he alleged that Forms 37A had been altered. These included Embu County Primary School, Kirimari Boys Secondary School, Minai Coffee Factory, Muvandori Primary School, Ndatu Catholic Church grounds, Gichago Coffee Factory, Gikirima Coffee Factory, Kathugu Primary School, and St Michael’s Primary School, among others.   ",
            "\t7. During cross-examination by Mr Kibicho for the 1st and 2nd respondent, the petitioner asserted that he did write to the elections officials asking for copies of the relevant election results forms and raise issues with them over the irregularities that he had noted, but his efforts were rebuffed by the officials. He asserted that he had issues with 426 polling stations. He conceded that he had no problem with the voting process, which he said went smoothly, but insisted that his problem was with the total votes announced. He further said that he had no problem with the votes in the ballot boxes. He averred that his agents were entitled to be given copies of Forms 37A and 38B. When he was showed Forms 37A and 37B for Kamviu Primary School, Githunguriri Tea Buying Centre, Karau Primary School and Igumo Catholic Church grounds, he conceded that there were errors across the board where all the candidates lost votes or were credited votes they had not garnered during the transposition of the results from Form 37A to Form 37B. He conceded that the ballots for the gubernatorial election were counted last after the Presidential, Member of Parliament, Member of County Assembly, Woman Member of Parliament and Senator, and that that exercise usually started in the small hours of the morning of the next day. He conceded that the staff involved would work long hours and would by then be exhausted and could make mistakes in the process. He asserted that he was in court because of such mistakes so that if any were made then they could be corrected. He asserted that the 1st and 2nd respondents inflated results for the 3rd respondent, saying that the damage done to him was greater than that done to the other candidates, but conceding that in some stations results were inflated to his favour. On his agents, he was shown forms in respect of Embu County Primary School, Gathangariri Nursery School, Kivangua Coffee Factory, Kithegi Coffee Factory, among others, he conceded that some forms were indeed signed by his agents, but added that he needed to go back to his records to confirm whether some of the names appearing in the forms were for his agents. He asserted that in some cases his agents were chased away. He conceded, when confronted with material, that some of the agents he had denounced were actually his genuine agents. On swapping of results, he started that he was referring to the discrepancy between the results in the records held by his agents and those reflected in the forms prepared by the officials of the 1st respondent. He said that his agents were intimidated by presiding officers, even though he did not mention any of them by name.   On the KIEMS kits, he said that he was not sure if he was interested in them, as the same had be removed and he did not think that the data in the kits would be relevant. He asserted that he was only interested in the ballot boxes. He said that he had abandoned the allegation that the officials of the 1st respondent had put water in ballot boxes after the elections body had explained what had happened and after establishing that the ballot papers were stored in tamper proof envelopes. He said he was confident with the integrity of the electoral materials. He testified that his petition was about numbers. He said that according to his tabulation he had won the election by a margin of 569 votes, after taking into account the votes given to the 3rd respondent by error and the votes that he and the 3rd respondent had been denied by error.",
            "\t8. The petitioner was cross-examined next by Mr Ahmednassir for the 3rd respondent. He conceded that the voting phase of the elections was peaceful, there was no violence and that whoever was entitled to vote voted. He said that none of his supporters were denied a chance to vote. He asserted that his problem was with the counting and tallying of votes. He said that there were irregularities with the transposition of results from one form to the next, which, in his view, amounted to fraud or rigging or illegal manoeuvring. He said the results declared were wrong. He said he could not tell how many votes the 3rd respondent garnered, except that he had lost to him, adding that that could only be known after a recount. He denied that after a recount the 3rd respondent would still win by 530 votes. He stated that he had listed polling stations in his petition where results were exaggerated; another list was of cases where votes were swapped and the other where the results were doctored.  He stated that he did not believe that more people voted than were in the registers in Manyatta and Runyenjes Constituencies, saying that it was not possible that 42 000 people voted who were not on the register of voters. When shown records of the 1st respondent, he conceded that the persons who voted in the two constituencies were less than the number of registered voters. He said that in a number of polling stations the candidates were given similar number of votes, and stated that that was evidence that the numbers were made up. He cited a number of such stations, which he said included Munyori Primary School, Kaweu Primary School, Ugweri, Gatundu Coffee Factory, Kirigi Primary School, Gatunduri Primary School, Ndumari Primary School, among others. He said he had issues with 426 polling stations; his complaint being that the counting and tallying was not done properly. He asserted that going by the records from his agents, he should have won by about 570 votes. He said that the results from his agents were not ‘cooked’ and he did not want to be declared winner based on them. He said he would not be satisfied with an audit based solely on Forms 37A, 37B and 37C; but with a recount. He said he would also like to be declared the winner based on the results of the recount.",
            "\t9. He was cross-examined next by Mrs Rugaita for the 4th respondent. He said that he was seeking recount only in three constituencies, that is to say Manyatta, Runyenjes and Mbeere South. He stated that he left out Mbeere North as he did not get enough material to establish issues there, although he did not mind a recount in the entire County. He said that he was not saying that no errors were committed in Mbeere North. He testified that he could not recall any of his agents being denied entry to a polling station In Mbeere North. He confirmed from material placed before him that his agents were present in the relevant polling stations. He also appointed out what he referred to as alterations on forms in respect of specific polling stations placed before him by Mrs Rugaita. He stated that although a polling official was at liberty to rectify any error that comes to his notice, the same must be done in the presence of the agents, failing which the same would amount to mischief. He said the errors apparent from the forms that he was confronted with were all human, and were correctable through a recount. In his view they affected the final tally.  .",
            "\t10. The petitioner called several of his agents to the witness stand. The first was Kenrodgers Munene Njiru. He was an agent of the petitioner at Embu County Primary School Stream 1. He said that the voting went well and there were no complaints. He was present at the counting, which he said was done professionally and there were no complaints. He said he was happy with the exercise. He noted the results declared by the presiding officer in his notebook. He signed the Form 37A for that polling station, and the results in his notebook tallied with what was in the form. He was followed by Justa Wawira Mwaniki. She was the petitioner’s agent at the Kithunguriri Tea Buying Centre. She was at the centre from the time it opened right up to the time counting was done and results declared. She testified that the voting went on well, no one complained and according to her the 1st respondent did a good job. The counting was completed at 5.00 a.m she recorded the results declared in her notebook, and was given Form 37A to sign and she signed the same. She said that it was given to her without difficulty. She said that the total number of votes cast in all the six elections was 334. Selesia Muthua came next. He was the petitioner’s agent at Karau Primary School. He said he made notes of the results as declared by the presiding officer at 9.00 a.m, and what he recorded tallied with what was in Form 37A. He stated that he did not sign Form 37A, although the same had in the column for agents his name. He said that he was not the Selasia Kinyua who was indicated in the form as having signed the same. He said he was the only agent from the petitioner’s party at that station, and denounced Luka Ngoroi Njeru who had been listed in Form 37A as having been present as agent for the petitioner’s political party. He said that 512 persons voted for the other five seats, save for Governor where 504 persons voted.  Joseph Njiru Munene was the petitioner’s witness at Mwenendega Primary School polling station stream 1. He said that he recorded the results in his notebook, but they differed with what was recorded in Form 37A, where the 3rd respondent was recorded as having scored 3 more votes than what had been announced. He said that although Form 37A indicated that he had signed the form, the actual position was that he never signed. He testified that he had asked the presiding officer to give the form to him to sign, but he was told to wait, and he eventually did not get to sign it.  He also said that according to his notes 444 electors voted, but the Form 37A puts the figure at 455. He asserted that he was present when the results were declared and that the results in his notebook was what was announced and not what was in Form 37A. Purity Mumbi Guthiga was the petitioner’s agent at Kagaari primary School polling station stream 2. She said that she did sign the Form 37A for that station, although her name was not reflected in the forms that the 1st respondent filed in court. She stated that the results in the form she signed tallied with the notes she took at the declaration of results, but the one filed in court had different results where the petitioner’s votes were reduced by 9. Robert Njue Kirembui was the petitioner’s agent at Kianjokoma Primary School polling centre. He stated that he signed Form 37A although the one filed in court did not bear his name. He said the results reflected in the form tallied with his notes save for the votes recorded in favour of the 3rd respondent. He said that although the form indicated the 3rd respondent as getting 336 votes in actual fact he got 186 votes or thereabouts. Catherine Nyaga was the petitioner’s agent at Embu Municipal Stadium Primary School stream 3. She recorded the results declared in her notebook although she did not sign Form 37A, which she said she asked for but was not given. She got a copy from a friend, which had the same results as those in her notebook. Gladys Njoki Mwaniki was the petitioner’s agent at Ena Primary School polling station stream 3. She testified that she recorded the results declared in her notebook and signed the relevant Form 37A. She however denounced the Form 37A filed in court by the 1st respondent, and also denounced the signature in the document purported to be hers. She asserted that the results reflected in Form 37A before the court were not correct for the petitioner and the 3rd respondent, and that in fact what was in her notes reflected the correct position.  Grace Nduku Musomi was an agent of the petitioner at Gategi Primary School polling station stream 1. She testified partially before she was stood down on account of discrepancies in her affidavit. She was not subsequently recalled, and her testimony shall therefore be disregarded.",
            "\t11. Three witnesses - Ambrose Muchungi Njeru, Daniel Njue Kamunda and James Njogu Muhigi - were called to testify on the events surrounding execution of orders that were obtained in late August 2017 with respect to preservation of electoral materials. That testimony is not relevant to the matters at hand.",
            "\t12. The case for the 1st and 2nd respondent opened on 15th December 2017, when the 2nd respondent, Daniel Lenarum, testified. He was the Elections Manager for Embu County, and the County Returning Officer in respect of the elections conducted on 8th August 2017. He testified that he was the one who declared the results for the gubernatorial election, which were as follows–",
            "\t(a) Kithinji Kiragu  - 50 440",
            "\t(b) Kivuti Lenny  - 96 775",

            "\t(e)  Njuki Peter Njagi – 981",
            "\t(f) Wambora Martin Nyaga – 97 760",
            "\tHe stated that polling took place at polling stations on 8th August 2017 without any incidents of violence, intimidation, voter bribery or of campaigns.  According to him all the processes regarding voting went on well. He stated that he did not receive any request for copies of the forms used to declare results. He asserted that no fraud was practiced at the County Tallying Centre, and that Form 37C was generated from Forms 37B received from the Constituency Returning Officers. He stated that he had no authority to change the results as reflected in Forms 37B. He said that from the Forms 37B submitted by the returning officer for Manyatta and Runyenjes Constituencies the total valid votes did not exceed the total registered votes for those two constituencies. Fewer people voted than those registered in the two constituencies. He denied that 42 000 persons voted in excess of those registered to vote. He said that for Runyenjes Constituency, there were 86 977 registered voters and out of that number 71 195 voted. For Manyatta, he said that there were 99 339 registered electors, out of which 79 964 voted. He said that there were minimal errors in the transposition of results from Forms 37A to Forms 37B. He explained that the same were clerical errors that could not affect the results that he declared.  He denied inflating the numbers or exaggerating or changing them to favour the 3rd respondent. He also denied swapping results or doctoring them, saying that what he announced was what he received from the constituencies which he aggregated to generate Form 37C. He said that there could a variance between the results for Governor and Woman Member of Parliament, but not to the extent of 10 000 votes as alleged by the petitioner.",
            "\t13. During cross-examination by Prof. Ojienda for the petitioner, and upon being confronted with the results declared for elections of Governor and Woman Member of Parliament the witness conceded that the difference between the two was over 10 000 votes. He explained that the same may have been on account of stray ballots from the other election she said that he was not informed of mistakes from transfer of materials from Forms 37A to 37B; but he did notice some disparities after the petition was filed. He said he was not aware of the specifics. He stated that Form 37B for Gategi Primary School polling station had an arithmetical error to the extent that it reflected the 3rd respondent as having garnered 482 votes there instead of 82 votes. He said he did not deal with Forms 37A for the constituency returning officers were only required to submit Form 37B only. He said he had no responsibility to go through Forms 37A and had not been briefed of any errors in them. He explained that the errors might have been occasioned by fatigue on the part of the election officials. He opined that the errors could be cured through re-tallying. He said that he had received no reports about alterations on Forms 37A, nor that some forms had not been signed by the agents, nor that they had been signed by fake agents, nor that some of the forms had not been signed by the presiding officer. He explained that after filling in the forms, the presiding officers are required to stamp them with an official stamp of the 1st respondent and the forms would be authentic if not signed by the presiding officer but are signed by the agents. He denied that some polling stations posted results that were similar to those in neighbouring polling stations. He conceded that some Forms 37A were not signed by agents of the petitioner, but asserted that they were signed by the agents who were present and who happened to be from other political parties.",
            "\t14.The second witness for the 1st and 2nd respondent was Amina Shakur Jarso, the Returning Officer for Runyenjes Constituency in the elections conducted on 8th August 2017. She testified that the said elections were conducted in accordance with the law. She said that she was not aware of any person who was entitled to vote who was denied a chance to do so. She said that she did proper tallying after voting came to an end, and that she did not inflate figures in favour of the 3rd respondent, neither did she swap results nor doctor them. She further denied that more persons voted than were in the register of voters for the constituency in question. She said that according to her records Runyenjes Constituency had a total of 86 977 registered voters, out of which 70 452 voted in the gubernatorial election, meaning that some 16 000 or so electors did not participate in the election. She stated that after going through her records after the filing of the petition she noted only one error, in Ugweri polling station stream 3 where the petitioner had been given 8 extra votes. She said she wanted that error corrected.",
            "\t15. During cross-examination, she conceded to the error at Ugweri polling station and stated that that was the only error she was aware of. She declared the results with the error. She stated that she could not alter the record from the presiding officers. On agents she said that she had briefed them, but it was not her responsibility to ensure that they were in attendance throughout. She said that her advice to presiding officers was that in the event an agent was absent, they ought to make a record of that and proceed to declare results, saying that results ought not to be withheld until all the agents had signed. She further stated that she did not inflate the results in favour of any of the candidates. She stated that she could not authoritatively talk about what transpired at the polling stations as she was not there and that she only dealt with Forms 37A as brought to her from the polling stations. She said that she was unaware of any alterations on Forms 37A, and further there was no significant difference between the votes cast in the gubernatorial election and those cast for the Woman Member of Parliament. She said that she declared the election results in the presence of agents, but the agent for the petitioner refused to sign the relevant form. She said that she asked him to but he refused to sign, although he did not object to what was going on. However, thereafter he began to say that she had refused to give him the form to sign, she stated that he was busy on phone and did not give much attention to what was happening.",
            "\t16.  Consolata Muthoni testified next. She was the Returning Officer for Mbeere South. She stated that that constituency had 72 143 registered voters, out of which 58 127 voted in the August 2017 election.   She testified that the process of casting ballots went smoothly in Mbeere South and there were no reports of violence. She stated that there an error in the posting of results from Gategi Primary School polling station stream 1 from Form 37A to 37B, where the 3rd respondent was awarded an extra 400 votes. She explained that the error was not intentional, and was perhaps caused by fatigue. She said that after cross-checking the whole of Form 37B she noted another error in Marimari Primary School polling station where the 3rd respondent’s votes were not recorded. During cross-examination, it transpired that there were other errors in other polling stations which the witness attributed to human error. In Munyori Primary School polling station, the petitioner’s votes were understated by 32 votes. In Kamutwanjiru Primary School polling centre, the petitioner’s votes were overstated by 9 votes, while there was another error at Kaweru Primary School polling station. She conceded that the results posted for Kaweru and Munyori polling stations were the same for the candidates, and said that there was nothing strange about that as such things could happen.",
            "\t17. The 1st respondent’s last witness, Faith Wambui Mugo, was the returning officer for Manyatta Constituency. She stated that the total number of registered voters for that constituency stood at 99 339, out of which 79 964 voted. She testified that the election was conducted in a peaceful and credible manner. There was no violence, the candidates did not campaign on election day and there was no case of vote buying.  She said that there were no issues with counting and votes were not inflated. She denied that the petitioner ever requested for a recount. She pointed out polling stations where there were errors such as Kivangua Coffee Factory, St Andrews Primary School, Kithunguriri Coffee Buying Centre Karau Primary School, Kamviu Primary School, Kathangari Nursery School, Mikimbi Full Gospel Church and Embu Municipal Stadium. In these stations the candidates lost votes or gained extra votes. The witness said that that happened at random and did not affect the overall result.  During cross-examination, she said that human errors occurred during transfer of data from Forms 37A to Form 37B, which she attributed to fatigue and disruptions occasioned by the petitioner. She said that she was considerably stressed due to the pressure and intimidation that she got from the petitioner.  She conceded to errors in the results recorded in Form 37B for Kithunguriri Tea Buying Centre, St Andrews Primary School, Karau Primary School, Nthambo Primary School, Embu Municipal Stadium, Embu Primary School and Mikimbi Full Gospel Church grounds polling stations, where candidates’ votes were either overstated or under recorded. She was confronted with several Forms 37A and asked questions on alterations thereon.  She responded that what she could see in some of the forms were not alterations but overwrites and pressing of the pen, saying that the same was done for emphasis where the original writing was faint. She explained that they were using coupons and there were upto six copies, and it would appear that some of the writings were not clear in the copies that were way down the pile and there was therefore need to emphasis the writing by overwriting. She was also cross-examined extensively about agents. She said that the law gives agents a role in the electoral process, but said that she was not aware that any of them were barred from accessing the polling stations. She said that they were supposed to sign the forms declaring the results, but they were often absent for various reasons, but their absence could not prevent the making of the declaration.",
            "\t18. The 3rd respondent was the last person to testify. He stated that he participated in the election and won fairly. He stated that the actual voting went on smoothly without incidents of violence or vote buying or electors being barred from voting or persons voting who ought not have been allowed to. He said that the 1st respondent did not give him undue advantage over the other candidates. He said that he visited the four constituency tallying centres and was satisfied that the exercise of tallying was carried out professionally and in a fair and transparent manner. He conceded that there were minor errors that were not intentional, which were of such nature that they could not affect the final result.  He said he was aware of polling stations where votes in his favor were not transposed, and also where he was awarded more votes than he had earned. He said that he did not create any Forms 37A. During cross-examination he denied that he had a hand in the hiring of election officials. He stated that he was opposed to the scrutiny and recount. He said that he did his own re-tallying and established that he had been awarded 300 votes by mistake. He said he was unaware that he had been awarded extra votes in various polling stations that were put to him by counsel. He also stated that he was unaware of alteration of Forms 37A.  When several such forms were placed before him, he said that all he could see was evidence of pressing of the pen to emphasize the writing.",
            "\t19. The 3rd respondent called on witness, Samuel Njeru, who testified on matters relating to execution of the orders that the court had made earlier on preservation of electoral materials. His testimony is therefore no relevant for the purpose of determining the matters at hand.",
            "\t20. The 4th respondent did not call any witnesses and elected to rely on the evidence on record.",
            "\t21. At the end of the oral hearing, the petitioner filed an application dated 28th December 2017, seeking scrutiny and recount of the ballots cast in the gubernatorial election. After hearing submissions from counsel and reviewing authorities I allowed, in a ruling that I delivered on 18th January 2018, a partial scrutiny limited to recount of ballots in specified polling stations in Mbeere South, Manyatta and Runyenjes Constituencies. I also allowed a re-tally of the relevant forms. The 3rd respondent also filed an application dated 19th January 2018 seeking a tally of all Forms 37A and 37B for all the polling stations in Embu County.  On the basis of that application I made orders on 24th January 2018 extending recount of ballots to six polling stations and directed the Deputy Registrar to carry out a re-tally exercise of Forms 37A, 37B and 37C in respect of the polling stations that were not going to be subjected to recount.",
            "\t22. The exercise ordered on 18th and 24th January 2018 was carried out by the Deputy Registrar for Embu High Court, Vincent Obondi Nyakundi, who had been appointed by the Chief Justice as the Deputy Registrar for the purposes of the instant cause, assisted by other deputy registrars and other court staff. The Deputy Registrar thereafter compiled a report which was subsequently filed in court on 7th February 2018. The Deputy Registrar also filed the original forms used in the partial scrutiny, duly filled by hand and signed by the agents of all the parties and by the Deputy Registrar.",
            "\t23. The report states that the Deputy Registrar and his team designed forms that they used to capture details of the result of the partial scrutiny for every ballot box scrutinized. The form was verified, at the end of the scrutiny of each ballot box, by agents of the parties to this cause before they appended their signatures on it. After all had executed the same, the agents would then be given copies thereof for their retention. The only observations made in the report relate to Munyori Primary School polling station where there were discrepancies as between what was reflected in Forms 37A, 37B and 37C and Gakundu Coffee Factory polling station where the Deputy Registrar had to carry out scrutiny in the two streams as there had been an error in the order which had not specified which of the two streams was to be the subject of the recount. The result of the recount and re-tally of Forms 37A is as follows. According to the report –",

            "\t24. Upon receipt of the report of the Deputy Registrar on 7th February 2018, I directed the parties to file and serve their respective final submissions to be highlighted on 13th February 2018. There was compliance with the directions as all the parties filed their respective written submissions complete with the authorities that they relied on. The submissions were highlighted on 13th February 2018. I have noted the arguments advanced in the written submissions as well as in the highlights. I have also perused through the authorities filed and cited and noted the legal points in each one of them.",
            "\t25. Prof Ojienda for the petitioner urged the court that the petitioner was seeking two prayers, for declaration that the 3rd and 4th respondents had not been validly elected, and an order nullifying the results. He submitted that the critical issues were whether the elections were conducted in accord with the relevant law. He urged that there was non-conformity with the Constitution and electoral laws, and there were irregularities that affected the election. He stated that the petitioner had discharged the burden cast on him. He pointed out that it had been admitted that there were errors with regard to entry of the results, which necessitated the partial scrutiny. He stated that Articles 81 and 86 of the Constitution obliged the electoral body to conduct an election that was accurate, verifiable, transparent and accountable.   He asserted that the scrutiny was done in 356 polling stations and irregularities emerged in 258 of the polling stations. It was submitted that the fact of irregularities in 258 polling station out of 356 was indicative of the mess in the way the counting and tallying of votes was done, which in turn compromised or tainted the integrity of the election. It was argued that as a result it cannot be said that the election was transparent, verifiable or accurate as required by the Constitution.  He submitted that there were some 18 polling stations and another 11 with issues. Regarding the 18, it was submitted that the said 18 ballot boxes had counterfoils, but the ballot papers in the boxes exceeded those indicated in the counterfoils. It was also submitted that the total extra votes not supported by the counterfoils amounted to 165 votes. The written submissions indicate that in 11 polling stations the counterfoils of the used ballots were missing. It was submitted further that as a result of these anomalies the final election result cannot be ascertained, and I am invited to nullify the results in respect of these two groups of polling stations, that is to say the 18 where the ballot papers in the boxes exceeded the number issued from the counterfoils by 165 ballots and the 11 where the counterfoils of the used ballots for the polling stations were not found in the boxes. The petitioner proposes that once I nullify the results in these 29 polling stations, I should declare him the winner for without the results of the 29 polling stations he would be ahead of the 3rd respondent by over 4 000 votes.  It was submitted that the alternative to declaring the petitioner the winner of the electoral contest should be nullification of the election.",
            "\t26. Counsel for the 1st and 2nd respondents, Mr Ngige, did not directly address the issue of the 29 polling stations as raised by Prof Ojienda. He argued that the petitioner moved the court for a recount, which the court acceded to, the ballots were recounted and the results released, he should not turn back and renounce the said results. He further submitted that the petition did not have a prayer for nullification, as it sought mere declarations. He further submitted that the scope of the scrutiny was limited to recount and re-tally, and that the issues the petitioner was raising concerning the report of the Deputy Registrar, such as on the counterfoils, were new matters and the respondents had no opportunity to respond to them. He stated that the petitioner had overall not proved the allegations that he had made in his petition.",
            "\t27. Mr. Ahmednassir for the 3rd respondent argued that the petitioner had not prayed for nullification of the election, as he had limited his case to a recount in anticipation that the same would show him as the winner. He submitted that the there is no prayer for nullification and repeat election on the basis of breach of statute or the Constitution. He urged that the court to confine itself to the pleadings in its determination of the matter. He submitted that the petition as framed limited the scope of the issues for determination, which he stated was very narrow. He cited several authorities to support his contention. He further submitted that the report of the Deputy Registrar on scrutiny or recount was binding. He asserted that where there was a scrutiny and the numbers did not change then the inescapable conclusion should be that even if there were irregularities the court should not interfere.",
            "\t28. Counsel for the 4th respondent did not make oral submissions. She associated herself with the submissions made by counsel appearing for the other respondents.",
            "\t29. The petitioner makes seven (7) prayers in his petition, which I may summarize as follows-",
            "(a) Re-tally of the votes cast in Gategi Primary School 1 and New Site Market polling stations;",
            "(b) Scrutiny and recount of the ballots cast in all polling stations within Runyenjes and Manyatta Constituencies and more specifically those set out in that prayer;",
            "(c) A declaration that  the 3rd and 4th respondents were not validly elected on 8th August 2017,",
            "(d) The election of the  3rd respondent as Governor be determined and declared null and void;",
            "(e) A declaration that the petitioner was validly elected as the Governor for Embu County;",
            "(f) Costs; and",
            "(g) Any other relief.",
            "\t30. The first two prayers in the petition are spent, that is those relating to re-tally, scrutiny and recount. They were disposed of in the two rulings that the court delivered on 18th and 24th January 2018, when it directed the Deputy Registrar to carry out a partial scrutiny limited to recount and re-tally. The Deputy Registrar carried out the exercise of partial scrutiny and has filed a report, from which it emerges that the 3rd respondent was the overall winner of the gubernatorial contest in Embu County. So those two prayers are not available for consideration. I am left with the remaining prayers – the nullification of the election of the 3rd and 4th respondents and the declaration of the petitioner as the person validly elected as Governor.",
            "\t31. I have read and re-read the remainder of the prayers in the petition, in particular prayers C, D and E, and I am persuaded that they are consequential to prayers A and B of the petition. I have carefully perused through the averments in the body of the petition and juxtaposed them against the prayers, and it would appear to me that the petitioner’s case, as laid out in the pleadings and the prayers, was geared to obtaining a recount of the ballots cast in the last election on the proposition that should there be a recount he would emerge the winner. The tenor of his pleadings is that something went wrong with the counting process resulting in the 3rd respondent being returned as victor. My reading of the averments is that upon a recount being done then all the issues raised in the petition would be answered. The principal complaints by the petitioner are detailed in paragraph 101 of the petitioner relating to inflated, swapped and doctored results, among others. His oral testimony too pointed to conduct of a recount as he was confident that he would emerge the winner. A recount showing him as the leading candidate would then lead automatically to a nullification of the results that returned the 3rd and 4th respondents as victors and a declaration, founded on section 80(4)(a) of the Elections Act, that the petitioner was the candidate who had won and who ought to have been issued with a certificate to that effect.",
            "\t32.  I have seen from the petitioner’s written submissions that issues have been raised that the totals in the Deputy Registrar’s report are not correct. He asserts that the votes he garnered in Kiritiri Primary School stream 1 and Kagumoini Dispensary – Don Bosco stream 2 have been understated. According to his arithmetic the results of the partial scrutiny should have given the 3rd respondent a win by a margin of 520 votes or thereabout, and the results ought to have been as follows after recount and re-tally of Forms 37A –",
            "\t(a) Cyrus Njiru - 2357",
            "\t(b) Kiragu Kithinji – 50850",
            "\t(c) Lenny Maxwell Kivuti -  97141",
            "\t(d) Leonard Muriuki Njeru - 2017",
            "\t(e) Martin Nyaga Wambora - 97659",
            "\t(f) Peter Njagi Njuki – 924.",
            "\tThe totals from the recount and re-tally of Forms 37B and 37C should have been as follows-",
            "\t(a) Cyrus Njiru – 2359",
            "\t(b) Kiragu Kithinji – 50837",
            "\t(c) Lenny Maxwell Kivuti -  97109",
            "\t(d) Leonard Muriuki Njeru - 2016",
            "\t(e)Martin Nyaga Wambora - 97662",
            "\t(f) Peter Njagi Njuki – 923.",
            "\tEither way the 3rd respondent would still be ahead. I find it curious though that the figures of the margin in the petitioner’s calculations come very close to the figure of 530 votes that the 3rd respondent’s advocate put to the petitioner as the margin of victory for his client should the court order a recount.",
            "\t33. Counsel for the 3rd respondent submitted that the exercise conducted by the Deputy Registrar effectively disposed of prayers C, D and E of the petition. The recount returned the result that the 3rd respondent was the winner of the contest, the consequence of which would be that there would be no basis for nullifying his election and declaring the petitioner as the person validly elected as Governor. That would be the natural consequence of the prayers as set out in the petition. The scrutiny that was ordered in the rulings delivered on 18th and 24th January 2018 was partial, limited to recount of the ballots cast in specific polling stations with a view to ascertain the number of votes garnered by each of the candidates who participated in the election. The re-tallying was to a similar vein. Since that was done and the 3rd respondent emerged as the winner, it would appear that prayers C, D and E of the petition have been effectively disposed of.",
            "\t34. I, however, need to address my mind to the issue of nullification of results in the 29 polling stations raised by the petitioner. The counter position by the respondents is that the issue raised regarding the 29 polling stations is a new matter in respect which they do not have opportunity to respond. They argue that dealing with it would amount to expanding the scope of the matter beyond the pleadings which is not countenanced in law.",
            "\t35. On the issue of confining myself to the pleadings, several authorities were cited. In Mr Charles C. Sande vs. Kenya Cooperative Creameries Limited Mombasa Civil Appeal No. 154 of 1992, the Court of Appeal said that -",
            "‘... in our view, the only way to raise issues before a Judge is through the pleadings and as far as we are aware, that has always been the legal position. All the rules of pleadings and procedure are designed to crystalize the issue which the Judge is to be called upon to determine and the parties are themselves made aware well in advance as what the issues between them are.’",
            "\tIn Nairobi City Council vs. Thabiti Enterprises Ltd (EA) 1995-98) 231, at page 21, Akiwumi JA said -",
            "‘I must now turn to another issue … whether the Learned Judge had any jurisdiction to determine the compensation value of the suit land without the pleadings in the suit having been amended to make this an issue in the suit, notwithstanding the apparent acquiescence of the parties to this procedure. In this regard , Mr Ngatia for the Appellant cited a number of cases in support of his proposition that a Judge does not have jurisdiction to determine a matter which has not been pleaded unless the pleadings are suitably amended…’",
            "\tThe other decision is in David Sironga ole Tukai vs. Francis arap Muge & 2 others (2014) eKLR, where the Court of Appeal stated that –",
            "‘It is well established in our jurisdiction that the court will not a grant a remedy, which has not been applied for, and that it will not determine issues, which the parties have not pleaded. In an adversarial system such as ours, parties to litigation are the ones who set the agenda, and subject to rules of pleadings, each party is left to formulate its own case in its own way. And it is for the purpose of certainty and finality that each party is bound by its own pleadings. For this reason, a party cannot be allowed to raise a different case from that which it has pleaded without due amendment being made. That way, none of the parties is taken by surprise at the trail as each knows the other’s case is as pleaded. The purpose of the rules of pleading is also to ensure that parties define succinctly the issues so as to guide the testimony required on either side with a view to expedite the litigation through  diminution of delay and expense.",
            "The court, on its part, is itself bound by the pleadings of the parties. The duty of the court is to adjudicate upon the specific matters in dispute, which the parties themselves have raised by their pleadings. The court would be out of character were it to pronounce any claim or defence not made by the parties as that would be plunging into the realm of speculation and might aggrieve the parties or, at any rate, one of them. A decision given on a claim or defence not pleaded amounts to a determination made without hearing the parties and leads to denial of justice.’",
            "\t36. The authorities above pronounce the law as it is relates to civil proceedings such as the one that I am now conducting. I agree the new issue turns on counterfoils. It is a matter that is not pleaded in the petition, and there 1st respondent did not have opportunity therefore to address it during trial. It may therefore amount to an ambush to deal with it at this stage. However, it should also be noted that the instant proceedings are sui generis. They are civil by nature, but subject to their unique procedures. It may be well to consider case law relating to election disputes.",
            "\t37. It would appear that the legal position could be different with respect to electoral disputes, although the same has not be articulated with helpful clarity. The general principle is that courts should proceed with caution with respect to material that may be unearthed during scrutiny and recount, for scrutiny and recount are not designed to discover new evidence or unpleaded matters that may found basis for nullification of an election. There is a wealth of case law on this, same of it from the Supreme Court. In Peter Gichuki King’ara vs. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 2 others Election Petition No. 3 of 2103, the Supreme Court said–",
            "‘The law on scrutiny and recount … suggests that scrutiny and recount … is not a gambling exercise that sets the court to rummaging through the ballot boxes to see whether any scintilla of evidence of electoral malpractice or irregularity can be found. If the petition is based on any particular electoral malpractice or irregularity that would warrant scrutiny or recount of votes, the malpractice or irregularity must be pleaded  and the evidence of such malpractice or irregularity laid out or established prior to an order for scrutiny or recount; the court must be satisfied that, on the basis of the evidence before it, it is necessary to call for a scrutiny and recount, if not for anything else, to confirm the truth of the particular evidence.’",
            "\t38. From the available case law, it would appear that there are three possible approaches to such unpleaded material unearthed after recount and scrutiny. The first one mirrors the general principle. The court may ignore such material and proceed to dismiss the petition should the petitioner fail to prove the allegations made in his pleadings. That position was stated by the Supreme Court in Gatirau Peter Munya vs. Dickson Mwenda Kithinji & 2 others Supreme Court Petition No. 2B of 2014. The second approach appears to be that a party is at liberty to pose questions on such unpleaded materials and the court may make findings on the effect of such irregularities on the declared results. The Supreme Court stated so in the case of Zacharia Okoth Obado v Edward Akong’o Oyugi & 2 others [2014] eKLR.  The other approach is that the court ought not to turn a blind eye on serious electoral malpractices or irregularities as may be exposed by scrutiny or recount merely because they were not pleaded.  That position was stated by the High Court in Musikari Nazi Kombo vs. Moses Masika Wetangula & 2 others (2013) eKLR. The said decision was challenged by way of appeal and the Supreme Court pronounced itself in Moses Masika Wetangula vs. Musikari Nazi Kombo & 2 others [2015] eKLR  as follows–",
            "“[137]  Section 83 of the Elections Act empowers the election Court to declare an election to be valid or invalid, following an election petition, on the basis of certain conditions.  The Court cannot appear to condone illegality in the election process, and would therefore investigate any alleged breaches of the law, even where these were not in the pleadings but arose in the course of the trial.”",
            "\t39. All three approaches suggest to me that an electoral court can look at the material that emerges from a scrutiny or recount and which is unpleaded and make a decision one way or the other with respect to the same. A court is not precluded from studying the materials merely because the same was not pleaded. Whether the same influences the direction of the matter should take thereafter will depend on the nature of the unpleaded material and the extent that it affects the final outcome.",
            "\t40. Looking at the written submissions of the petitioner, I do note that the petitioner has flagged out three issues that he submits emerge from the exercise undertaken by the Deputy Registrar. It is said that there were 18 polling stations where the gubernatorial ballots cast exceeded the number of the ballots reflected in the counterfoils, that in 26 other polling stations the ballot boxes did not have the requisite Forms 37A, in 11 others the ballot boxes did not have the used counterfoils and in 216 others, it is said that the counterfoils of the used ballot papers totaled more than the ballot papers found in the ballot box. It is argued that the existence of ballots that exceed those issued as per the used counterfoils suggests that there were excess votes, or, put differently, there was ballot stuffing. The excess ballots were put at 165 and it could not be ascertained in whose favor they had been cast. Regarding the missing Forms 37A, it is submitted that it was impossible to confirm the results as counted during the August polls. On the missing counterfoils, it is submitted that without them it would be impossible to know how many ballot papers were utilized. Where the total used ballot counterfoils exceed the ballot papers in the box suggests that the said ballots were lost, and it is not known in whose favour they had been cast.",
            "\t41. I have taken the liberty of looking at the forms that the Deputy Registrar designed for the purpose of the partial scrutiny to ascertain the veracity of the petitioner’s submissions. The form has 10 columns capturing various details. There are columns that capture information on the total number of counterfoils used, the serial numbers of the used ballot papers/counterfoils and the unused ballot papers/counterfoils. There are also columns capturing information relating to the seals both before and after scrutiny, with comments on whether they were found intact or broken. There is too another for the names and signatures of the representatives of the parties. Then there is space for notes, where the Deputy Registrar has made observations with respect to such matters as existence of stray ballots, ballots that were disputed, missing or illegible or unstamped Forms 37A, ballots that are missing or are unaccounted for, materials not sealed in the tamper proof envelopes, missing counterfoils, used and unused booklets for other elections found in the box, among others.  The said forms were the working notes of the Deputy Registrar and the material in them is what was used to generate his report.  The forms form part of the proceedings. The matters recorded in the notes of the Deputy Registrar are no doubt an indication that there were irregularities in the counting exercise.",
            "\t42. Section 83 of the Elections Act states that–",
            "‘No election shall be declared to be void by reason of non-compliance with any written law relating to that election if it appears that the election was conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Constitution and in that written law or that the non-compliance did not affect the result of the election.’",
            "\t43. The import of section 83 is that as a general rule, the court should not interfere with results where irregularities or non-compliance with the law is established so long as the election appears to have been conducted in accordance with the Constitution and the law and the non-compliance did not affect the result.",
            "\t44. The Supreme Court in Gatirau Peter Munya vs. Dickson Mwenda Githinji & 2 others interpreted section 83 in the following terms–",
            "\t‘[208]. It is clear to us that an election should be conducted substantially in accordance with the principles of the Constitution, as set out in Article 81. Voting is to be conducted in accordance with the principles set out in Article 86. The Elections Act and the Regulations thereunder constitute the substantive and procedural law for the conduct of elections … If it should be shown that an election was conducted substantially in accordance with the principles of the Constitution and the Elections Act, then such election is not to be invalidated only on the grounds of irregularities. Where, however, it is shown that the irregularities were of such magnitude that they affected the election result, then such an election stands to be invalidated. Otherwise, procedural or administrative irregularities and other errors occasioned by human imperfection are not enough by and of themselves, to vitiate an election … Where an election is conducted in such manner as demonestrably violates the principles of the Constitution and the law, such an election stands to be invalidated.",
            "[209]. …",
            "[210]. …",
            "[211]. … a petitioner who is able to satisfactorily prove either of the two limbs of the Section can void an election. In other words, a petitioner who is able to prove that the conduct of the election in question substantially violated the principles laid down in the Constitution as well as other written law on elections , will on that ground alone, void an election. He will also be able to void an election if he is able to prove that although the election was conducted substantially in accordance with the principles laid down in our Constitution as well as other written law on elections, it was fraught with irregularities or illegalities that affected the result of the election’",
            "\t45.  The High Court had before then pronounced itself on these matters along the same lines in Joho vs. Nyange (2008) 3 KLR (EP), when it said–",
            "‘The law if therefore clear as to when an election can be nullified. An election will be nullified if it is not conducted substantially in accordance with the law as to elections. It will also be nullified, even though substantially conducted in accordance with the law as to elections, if there are errors or mistakes in conducting the elections which, however trivial, are found to have affected the result of the elections.’",
            "\t46. Guided by the principles stated above I shall proceed to address my mind first to the question whether the election the subject of these proceedings was conducted substantially in accordance the Constitution and the relevant electoral law. The petitioner when he testified stated categorically that the voting process went on smoothly. He did not raise any issues whatsoever with respect to the campaign period. His petition was grounded solely on matters around the counting and declaration of results. The 3rd respondent did not raise any issues at all regarding the entire electoral process, from the campaigns to the declaration of results. I can in the circumstances conclude that the first phase of the election, the campaigns and the voting processes, was substantially conducted in accordance with the Constitution and the electoral law. It cannot be said that first phase of the election was conducted so badly that there was really no election at all. However, it has emerged from the material generated by the scrutiny that there were irregularities or non-compliance with the law on elections. The question then is whether these irregularities or errors or non-compliance with the law should invalidate the election the subject of these proceedings.",
            "\t47. To answer the question that I have posed above, I shall address each of the irregularities or errors or non-compliance with the law one at a time. The irregularities identified relate to material that ought to have been found in the ballot boxes during recount. Regulation 81(1) of the Elections (General) Regulation 2012 is relevant. Regulation 81(1) is in mandatory terms. The effect of non-compliance with it would depend on the impact of the non-compliance on the total result. It states as follows-",
            "‘Upon completion of a count, including a recount, the presiding officer shall seal in each respective ballot box–",
            "(a) valid votes,",
            "(b) rejected ballots sealed in  a tamperproof envelope,",
            "(c) unused ballot papers sealed in a tamperproof envelope,",
            "(d) counterfoil of used ballot papers sealed in a tamperproof envelope,",
            "(e) copy of election results declaration forms, and ",
            "(f) stray ballot papers in a tamperproof envelope.’",
            "\t48. The first non-compliance relates to failure to put and seal in the ballot boxes all the ballot papers used in the election, whether valid or rejected, contrary to Regulation 81. The record filed by the Deputy Registrar of the forms used during the partial scrutiny reveal that varying numbers of ballots in 184 polling stations were unaccounted for. The number of such ballots is 566. This is a case where the ballots actually cast are less than the total number of counterfoils of used ballot papers. It cannot be ascertained as to whether they were spoilt or rejected or valid, and if valid in whose favour they were cast.",
            "\t49. The second non-compliance relates to omission to put and seal counterfoils of used ballot papers in the ballot boxes contrary to Regulation 81(1). The record of the forms used by the Deputy Registrar during the recount reveal that in 11 polling stations the counterfoils of the used ballot papers are missing, or, put differently, were not found in the respective ballot boxes. It cannot be ascertained therefore how many ballot papers were issued to electors and used, and therefore it would mean that the results cannot be ascertained and verified. It would appear that the ballot papers in the relevant ballot boxes were recounted against the record in Forms 37A for the relevant polling stations, but the accuracy of the record in Forms 37A cannot be ascertained without the counterfoils of the ballots used in those polling stations.",
            "\t50. The third non-compliance is with respect to Form 37A. I have gone through the handwritten record of the forms that the Deputy Registrar prepared for the scrutiny and it discloses that in 12 polling stations there were no Forms 37A in the ballot boxes, and in 12 other polling stations copies of the Forms 37A found in the boxes were totally illegible.  Form 37A is a critical document for the purpose of collation, tallying and declaration of results. Without the form, or even where the same has been rendered useless by illegibility, there cannot be any results to declare, as it is, it is this document which authenticates the results. This would effectively mean that the results of the election in the 26 polling stations have not been authenticated and validated.",
            "\t51. The other issue, which is really not a matter of non-compliance, but an irregularity nevertheless, is about what the petitioner has called excess votes. These are ballot papers found in the ballot boxes  during recount which did not issue out of the ballot booklets for the relevant polling stations for they could not be traced to the counterfoils of used ballot papers found in the ballot boxes. Such ballot papers in varying numbers were found in 12 ballot boxes from the record of the Deputy Registrars handwritten forms.  The total excess ballot papers cast amounted to 111. This is an irregularity that seriously undermines the electoral process as it suggests that these materials were introduced into the ballot boxes unprocedurally. The effect is to defeat or subvert and distort the will of the people. The excess votes are not authentic and should not be in the system. Such ballots could only get in through an illegal process, and an outcome which is arrived at with such votes being taken into account cannot be said to be fair or accurate or authentic or verifiable.",
            "\t52. The petitioner has urged that in view of the non-compliance or the irregularities disclosed the court should nullify the results in those polling stations, in which case he would emerge the winner and the court should proceed to declare him the duly elected Governor for Embu County. With respect, that submission is not tenable. Elections are about electors expressing their will at the voting booth as to who should lead them. Compiling the total results while excluding the votes of the electors in the affected polling stations would amount to disenfranchising them, something that the court should not countenance.",
            "\t53. In the alternative, he pleads that the court should nullify the entire election. The respondents submitted that there is no jurisdiction to do so as there is no prayer in the petition for nullification, and in any event the issue of those irregularities in question should not arise as they were not pleaded. I have dealt with that issue in the foregoing paragraphs, and held that the law does allow an election court to make decisions with respect to unpleaded material that emerges after recount. The matter before me is not a suit commenced by plaint, but a petition. The petitioner has moved the court so that it can review the election conducted on 8th August 2017 to confirm and ascertain whether the same was conducted in accordance with the law and to audit the systems to determine whether the same produced results that were accurate, verifiable and accountable. The scrutiny and recount exercise was designed to determine that, and if it produced material that was not in the pleadings the court cannot ignore the same, but should look at it in the wider interests of electoral justice.",
            "\t54. The second issue that I need to resolve is whether the irregularities noted above are of such nature as would affect the result declared in August 2017 or even that of the recount. The general principle as stated above is that even where an election was substantially conducted within the law, the court can still nullify the results if it is established that the irregularities noted affected the results. I have already made a finding that the election herein was substantially conducted according to the law, save for the irregularities noted during the recount. What I should determine is whether the non-compliance with the law or the errors noted affected the final results.",
            "\t55. According to the report of the Deputy Registrar, the final tally of the results shows that the difference between the votes garnered by the petitioner and the 3rd respondent is between 700 and 800 votes. The petitioner claims that that tally was erroneous and according to his own tally the margin is a little narrower and should be in the region of 500 votes. Are the irregularities identified through the scrutiny likely to affect the result? I have noted that the non-compliance with regard to the unaccounted ballots affects ballots in the region of 566 votes, while that relating to missing counterfoils affects ballots in the region of 4000 votes, while those relating to missing or illegible Forms 37A are in excess of 10 000 votes. The excess votes amount to 111. Looking at all these figures globally there is no doubt that the irregularities would affect the final results of the election.",
            "\t56. I have come to the conclusion that the irregularities or errors or non-compliance with the law during the collating, counting and tallying of votes in the gubernatorial election held for Embu County on 8th August 2018 undermined the electoral process fundamentally and produced a result that cannot be said to be accountable, verifiable or accurate. Consequently, it cannot be said to reflect the will of the people of Embu County. It has not been established that the 2nd, 3rd and 4th respondents were complicit in any way to the non-compliance and the irregularities identified, which appear to have been caused either by fatigue or incompetence on the part of the elections staff hired by the 1st respondent.",
            "\t57. The final orders that I shall make in the circumstances are as follows–",
            "\t(a) That I shall and do hereby allow the petition in the terms that the results of the election held on 8th August 2017 are hereby nullified and order that a fresh gubernatorial election  be held  for Embu County;",
            "\t(b) That costs, capped at Kshs. 3, 000, 000.00, subject to taxation, are awarded to the petitioner to be borne by the 1st  respondent in the sum of Kshs. 2, 000, 000.00 and the 3rd and 4th respondents at Kshs 1, 000, 000.00; and",
            "\t(c) That a certificate shall issue to the 1st respondent and the Speaker of Senate pursuant to Section 86 of the Elections Act.",

            "1.  I have before me two applications for hearing.  The First Application dated 12th February 2019 and filed by Mombasa Cement Ltd (the Defendant) prays for an order of temporary stay of execution of the Judgment delivered herein on 11th October 2018 as well as an order setting aside the said Judgment and re-opening the defence case for hearing.",
            "2.  The application which is supported by an affidavit sworn by the Defendant’s Operations Manager one Javed Mohamed Sidik is premised on the grounds inter alia:-",
            "a) That the Defendant has a good defence on record raising triable issues;",
            "b) That the Defendant has been in occupation of the suit property for more than ten years and its quarrying activities would come to a halt if it vacates the properties;",
            "c) That there is in place Judgment delivered in Mombasa HCCC No. 185 of 1991 in which the suit properties were declared to be a Wakf of the Mazrui and their Successors;",
            "d) That there was a pending application dated 31st December 2012 which had sought to bring forth the issue of the pending Judgment to the attention of the Court but it has not been dealt with; and",
            "e) That the Plaintiff shall not suffer any prejudice if the Judgment is set aside and that the Defendant’s failure to attend Court when the matter came up is excusable.",
            "3.  The Second Application dated 25th February 2019 is filed by an entity known as the Trustees of the Mazrui Community (Welfare and Development) Wakf Lands Trust(the Proposed Interested Parties) seeking to be enjoined to the suit as Interested Parties or Defendants. The Proposed Interested Parties also pray for the Judgment delivered herein on 11th October 2018 to be set aside and that the Court Registry does supply them with copies of all pleadings and documents filed herein.",
            "4.  The Second Application which is supported by an Affidavit sworn by the Trustees Chairman one Salim Al-Amin Suleiman Mazrui is premised inter alia on the grounds that:-",
            "a) The Applicants are vested with the management of all that property in Takaungu, Kilifi County, known as LR No. 4226;",
            "b) On 19th July 2012 vide a Judgment issued in Mombasa High Court in Constitutional Case No. 134 of 1991, the Court declared:",
            "i)   That the Mazrui Lands Trust (Repeal) Act of 1989 which had purported to divest the Applicants of the said property was illegal, unconstitutional, null and void for all purposes.",
            "ii)  That the said land belongs to the Mazrui exclusive of all others.",
            "iii) That the adjudication exercise (then carried out by the Government) was illegal and void ab-initio.",
            "c) That the instant Judgment herein purports to dispossess the Mazrui of their land and to disregard their right to be heard in the case.",
            "5.  Both applications are opposed.  In respect of the First Application, the Plaintiffs have through a Replying Affidavit sworn by their Advocate Patrick Shujaa Wara accused the Defendants of being guilty of laches.  The Plaintiffs aver that the Defendants have not given any reason why they failed to prosecute the application dated 31st December 2012.  They similarly accuse the Defendant of failing to give a reason for the delay in filing the present application given their knowledge of the proceedings of 4th December 2018.",
            "6.  The Plaintiffs further aver that the Defendant has not given any satisfactory reasons to account for the absence of its witnesses in Court on the date fixed for hearing of the defence case and on several other days before that.  They further aver that the Judgment delivered herein does not in any way conflict with that delivered in Mombasa HCCC No. 185 of 1991 and urge this Court to dismiss the application.",
            "7.  In regard to the Second Application, the Plaintiffs assert through a Replying Affidavit sworn by the 1st Plaintiff Samuel Charo Kitsao that the Proposed Interested Parties have not demonstrated how their presence was necessary for the effectual determination of the dispute herein. They assert that the Proposed Interested Party is a total stranger to the dispute and that its presence will only serve to convolute the matter which has already been heard and determined.",
            "8.  I have perused and considered the two applications as well as the responses thereto.  I have similarly considered the written submissions and authorities as placed before me by the Learned Advocates for the parties.",
            "9.  In the Frist Application herein, the Defendant urges this Court to set aside the Judgment delivered herein on 11th October 2018 and to re-open the defence case for hearing.  In support of that application the Defendant relies on a Supporting Affidavit sworn by its Operations Manager Javed Mohamed Sidik who avers inter alia that on 4th December 2018 when the matter came up for defence hearing, he was unavailable as his wife had been taken ill.",
            "10.  Order 10 Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Rules provides that:-",
            "“Where Judgment has been entered under this Order the Court may set aside or vary such Judgment and any consequential decree or order upon such terms as are just.”",
            "11. The Court in this respect has unfettered discretion to set aside or vary its Judgment.  This discretion must however be exercised judiciously.  As was stated in Shah –vs- Mbogo (1968) EA 93, the discretion is intended to be exercised to avoid injustice or hardship resulting from inadvertence or excusable mistake or error but not to assist a person who has deliberately sought, whether by evasion or otherwise to obstruct or delay the course of justice.",
            "12.  In the matter before me, the Defendant’s Operation Manager avers that he was aware of the hearing date of 4th December 2017.  He however asserts that he was prevented from attending the hearing as his wife had been ailing for some time and her condition had suddenly worsened on the date when the matter was to be heard.",
            "13.  That averment is unfortunately not supported by any evidence.  The Defendant has not attached any medical or other evidence to support the position that the wife to its Operations Manager had been ailing for some time or indeed on or around the date when this matter came for hearing.",
            "14.  A perusal of that day’s Court record shows that the Defendant’s Counsel had indicated to the Court at 9.00 a.m. that they would be ready for hearing.  The matter was then confirmed for hearing at 11.30 a.m.  However, when that time arrived, Counsel for the Defendant informed the Court that their witness had not yet arrived as expected and asked for an adjournment. The Advocate made no indication that the wife to the witness was unwell.",
            "15.  A further perusal of the record herein shows that the Plaintiff’s case was closed on 22nd June 2015.  Thereafter, this matter would be adjourned at least on eight (8) different occasions with the Defendant claiming that their director and witness one Ashok Patel (and not the deponent of the Supporting Affidavit) was either ill or abroad.  On 17th July 2017, the said witness was said to have passed away and the matter was again adjourned to enable the Defendant to substitute a new witness.",
            "16.  On 18th October 2019, when the matter next came for hearing, the Defendant was not in Court and the matter was adjourned after the Court was told that their Counsel had taken her child to hospital.  The matter was then adjourned to 4th December 2017 when again the Defendants sought another adjournment that was declined.",
            "17.  Even though they were aware that their case was closed on the said date, no application to re-open the same was made on account that their witness’ wife was unwell.  It was only after more than one year and after Judgment had been rendered and execution commenced that they came to this Court on 14th February 2019 claiming that the witness had been unable to attend Court for the reason given.",
            "18.  Unfortunately for them, the record herein does not make their case believable.  The numerous applications made for adjournment after the Plaintiffs closed their case coupled with the delay in making this present application is to me a demonstration of the deliberate attempts made to delay and obstruct the conclusion of this matter.  The allegation that their witness could not attend Court due to the illness of his wife is unsupported by any evidence and is clearly an afterthought.",
            "19.  In the circumstances I agree with the Plaintiff’s Submissions that the Defendant has failed to demonstrate an excusable mistake, inadvertence, accident or mistake or error either on its part or on the part of its Counsel on record to warrant the exercise of this Courts discretion in the Defendant’s favour. ",
            "20.  The application dated 12th February 2019 lacks merit and the same is dismissed.",
            "21.  In respect of the Second Application, the proposed Interested Party seeks to be enjoined to the suit on account that it is the registered proprietor of Plot No. 4236 Kilifi and that there is Judgment delivered on 19th July 2012 in Mombasa High Court Constitutional Case No. 185 of 2011 which declared that the land belongs to them.",
            "22.  Rule 10 (2) of Order 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules provides that:-",
            "“The Court may at any stage of the proceedings either upon or without the application of either party, and on such terms as may appear to the Court be just, order that the name of any party improperly joined, whether as Plaintiff or Defendant, be struck out and that the name of any person who ought to have been joined, whether as Plaintiff or Defendant, or whose presence before the Court may be necessary in order to enable the Court effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all questions involved in the suit, be added.” (Emphasis mine).",
            "23.  That being the case, the onus then is on the applicant to show that there are proceedings pending before  a Court and that its presence in that suit is necessary to enable the Court to effectually and completely adjudicate upon all the issues arising in that suit.  Such an applicant must similarly demonstrate that it has a stake or interest in the proceedings and that it stands to be adversely affected by the Judgment of the Court unless it is allowed to appear and articulate its case.",
            "24.  Courts will however decline to allow joinder of parties where such joinder will lead into practical problems of handling the existing cause of action together with the one of the party being enjoined; where it is unnecessary, or where it will just occasion unnecessary delay or costs on the parties in the suit.",
            "25.  I have looked at the application and the record herein.  In their consolidated suits herein as filed on 13th May 2010 and 14th February 2011, the Plaintiffs were seeking an order of injunction to restrain the Defendants from inter alia fencing the said properties, cutting down their trees and preventing them from accessing their land.  They further sought a mandatory injunction to compel the Defendant to pull down its fence erected over the land claimed by the Plaintiffs.",
            "26.  On the other hand, the Defendant pleaded among other things that it had purchased some of the parcels of land from some of the Plaintiffs and denied any encroachment on the Plaintiff’s parcels of land.  This Court heard the dispute between the two parties and made its determination on 11th October 2018.",
            "27.  As it were, the Proposed Interested Party was not a party to the already concluded proceedings and I did not hear them claim that they had been mentioned in the Judgment and/or that the Plaintiff/Decree-holders had sought to execute the Decree against them.  Other than their claim to ownership of LR No. 4236 I was unable to discern how their joinder into these proceedings would help the Court to effectually and completely adjudicate a matter that has already been concluded as between the protagonists that were hitherto before me.",
            "28.  From the Supporting Affidavit as filed before me, I was unable indeed to discern any conflict between the Judgment issued in Mombasa HCCC No. 185 of 1991 and the determination herein.",
            "29.  In the premises, I did not find merit in the Proposed Interested Party’s application either and the same is equally dismissed.",
            "30.  The Plaintiffs shall have the costs of the two applications.",

            "RULING",
            "By letter dated 16th February, 2005 the Appellant appealed against the 1st Respondent’s approval of the EIA Project Report submitted by the 2nd Respondent  in support of its application for an EIA licence for the development  of a housing estate to be known as Eagle Plains Housing Estate on plot L.R. No. 209/10829, Nairobi.  The land on which the estate is proposed to be developed adjoins the headquarters of the Appellant and lies in an area off Mombasa Road. Prior to seeking an EIA license the 2nd Respondent had commenced construction of the project, apparently unaware of the requirements of the Environmental Management and Coordination Act, 1999,  but on being informed of the need for an EIA licence it stopped construction. ",
            "The 1st Respondent’s approval, which led to this appeal, had been communicated by letter dated 3rd February, 2005 following the submission by the 2nd Respondent of an EIA Project Report. Consequently, the 2nd Respondent was not required by the 1st Respondent to carry out a full EIA Study.",
            "The Appellant’s objection was that the proposed residential project would not be in harmony with the existing industries surrounding the plot, of which the Appellant’s activity is one. The Appellant claimed that air pollution levels in the area are higher than the WHO standards for long term human exposure and that the heavy traffic density and 24 hour industrial operations produce high noise levels for a residential development.  In addition the Appellant argued that the proposed development, which was a proposal to construct a 350 unit housing estate inside an area in which no less than 13 industries were located, was “out of character with its surroundings.” Consequently, it could not be approved on the basis of the Project Report alone, and required a full Environmental Impact Assessment Study.",
            "The Appellant objected to the decision by the 1st Respondent not to require the 2nd Respondent to carry out a full EIA Study. Among the key benefits which the Appellant saw as arising from the conduct of a full EIA Study prior to a decision whether or not to grant an EIA license was the opportunity which it would provide to potentially affected parties, such as the Appellant, to air their views in the context of public consultation, which is a mandatory requirement of a full EIA Study.  The Appellant argued that in approving the project on the basis of a Project Report alone, the 1st Respondent had denied the Appellant an opportunity to provide comments. The Appellant subsequently took the position, however, that even if a full EIA Study had been conducted, it would not materially have affected the Appellant’s objection to this Project.",
            "The Tribunal heard the matter on three occasions between 23rd June, 2005 and 28th July 2005.  A total of four witnesses testified.  The Appellant called Dr. Jacob Kibwage, its EIA Consultant to give evidence.  The 1st Respondent called to give evidence Mr. Maurice Mbegera its Director of Compliance, who is responsible for EIA licensing, while 2nd Respondent called Mrs. Hellen Nzainga, the EIA consultant who had led the preparation of the EIA Report as well as Mr. Jumaa Makopa, the Associate EIA expert, responsible in this case for studying the air quality, noise levels and water quality implications of the proposed project. The Tribunal also visited the site of the proposed project on 29th July 2005. Final submissions were heard on 3rd August 2005.",
            "In evidence the Appellant faulted the EIA  Project Report on the ground that it had proceeded on the basis  that the only relevant consideration was the potential impact of the project  on the environment in the area in which the proposed project  was to be located.  On this basis, the Report had come to the conclusion that there were no potentially significant adverse impacts which the project was likely to inflict on the environment in its locality that could not adequately be mitigated.  In the Appellant’s view, this was completely the wrong premise on which to have proceeded.",
            "What the EIA team should have done, in the Appellant’s view, was to look at the potential impact on the proposed project of the environment in the locality.  Had they done so, they would have realized that an area with industrial activities, an allegedly high air and traffic noise pollution levels, the perceived risk of explosions arising from the manufacture of gas cylinders, possible danger from the manufacture of vaccines thought to be going on in the vicinity, and radiation arising from mobile phone transmitters located nearby, was not an appropriate area in which to locate a major residential estate.  But because the EIA Study team had not approached the matter in this way, they had not found it necessary to collect the relevant data that would have demonstrated the inappropriateness of this location for the proposed project.",
            "The witnesses for the Respondents defended the decision to grant approval on the basis of the Project Report alone.  They argued that the area in which the project was to be located is designated in the physical planning laws as zone 9, in which both light industrial and residential development are allowed.  They pointed out that the relevant regulatory authorities, including the Ministry of Lands and the City Council of Nairobi, had granted the required permits for the proposed development.  They sought to introduce in evidence a document titled: “A Guide of Nairobi City Development Ordinances and Zones” but this was resisted by the Appellant for the reason, among others, that it is merely a draft document whose authenticity is uncertain.  The witnesses further gave evidence of actual mixed developments that are to be found in the area in question, among them residential estates, a hotel, godowns, other commercial establishments and also light industries.",
            "During the hearing of the matter it was said and admitted by the Appellant’s witness, Dr Kibwage, that the primary reason which led the Appellant to object to this proposed development was the concern that the proposed development would introduce a conflict between the commercial activities carried out by the Appellant within its premises and the use of neighboring property for residential purposes.",
            "The Tribunal findings on the pertinent issues arising are set out below.",
            "The purpose of the EIA licensing process as prescribed by Part VI of the Environmental Management and Coordination Act of 1999 and the Environmental (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations, Legal Notice No 101 of 2003 which are made thereunder is to assess the likely significant impacts of a proposed project on the environment. In deciding on the nature of likely impacts, account must be taken of the status of the environment within which the proposed project will be undertaken. Consequently, the levels of air pollution, traffic noise and other features of the environment in the area off Mombasa Road on which this proposed development is to be carried out are relevant considerations.",
            "The status of that environment is not determined by the fact alone that the area is designated as an industrial area, or even as an area for mixed development.  Since the Tribunal is not sitting on appeal on the decisions of the physical planning authorities, such a designation, if it exists, is only indicative of the nature of environmental considerations that might arise.  What is critical for these proceedings is to ascertain the actual status of the environment in the locality. ",
            "The evidence that was adduced showed that the. For this purpose, in the absence of statutorily prescribed limits, Kenya relies on World Health Organization standards. The claims by the Appellant’s witness that residence within this locality would expose those living in the proposed estate to serious health risks on account of the high levels of pollution in the area were not substantiated by credible evidence.",
            "The Tribunal also finds that no evidence adduced by the Appellant’s witness or anyone else showed that this project would adversely impact on that environment in ways that could not be mitigated by the measures that had been proposed by the project proponent in the EIA Project Report. In addition to the proposed mitigatory measures, the 1st Respondent and other regulatory authorities can resort to provisions available in the Environmental Management and Coordination Act of 1999 and other laws, among them, the requirement for regular environmental audit, to require that the activities being carried on in the area within which the proposed project is to be located do not cause unavoidable environmental degradation.  Accordingly, there are mechanisms in place for managing the potential adverse environmental impacts that might arise from this project. ",
            "Further, before taking the decision, the 1st Respondent had consulted lead agencies as well as a number of potentially affected neighbours, including the Appellant. The Tribunal noted that the Appellant’s views had been communicated to the 1st Respondent by letter dated 18th November 2004, which was written on its behalf by Dr Kibwage. The Appellant’s argument that in not requiring a full EIA Study interested parties had been denied an opportunity to provide comments on the proposed project is thus not sustainable.",
            "Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the 1st Respondent was justified in approving the proposed project on the basis of the Project Report alone. Consequently, the Tribunal rules that the Appellant’s appeal against the 1st Respondent’s approval of the EIA Project Report fails.",
            "The Appellant pointed to a number of technical irregularities in the Project Report, among them the failure to date the Report, the failure to show evidence that the form of submission of the Report was signed by the project proponent, and the inclusion in the Project Report of matters, which in the Appellant’s view, went beyond the requirements of the Environmental (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations 2003 L.N. No. 101. The Tribunal notes that the same Project Report to which the Appellant objected formed the basis of these proceedings, including this Appeal and the actions that had been taken by the Respondents.",
            "The Tribunal is of the view that these irregularities do not vitiate the decision taken by the 1st Respondent on the central issue, that is, that the development of a residential estate in the proposed location is not likely to introduce significant adverse environmental impacts which cannot be mitigated through appropriate measures, such as those proposed in the EIA Project Report.",
            "The Tribunal therefore unanimously finds that the appeal fails and directs that:-",
            "1)   The Stop Order issued by the Tribunal on 9th May, 2005 by letter ref: NET/APLS/1/1/VOL. (1) be and is hereby lifted.",
            "2)   NEMA is at liberty to issue an EIA license to the 1st Respondent as prayed.",
            "The Tribunal was asked by the Parties to award costs. The Tribunal finds that the Appeal was well founded and is not frivolous. In making this finding the Tribunal has not overlooked the fact that the Appellant had objected to this project mainly because of its concern that a large residential estate next to its commercial headquarters would introduce a conflict with the Appellant’s activities being carried out next to that location. Despite this, the Appeal raised real issues falling within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, in particular whether the proposed project should not be licensed for being out of character with its surroundings. For this reason, the Tribunal rules that, in accordance with rule 39 of the National Environment Tribunal Rules, Legal Notice No. 191 2003, each party shall bear its own costs.",
            "The Tribunal notes that licensing this activity in no way takes away the rights of the parties under the general law to seek a remedy in nuisance should any of the licensed activities be carried out in a manner which would be remediable under the law of nuisance. This is the essence of the decision in Wheeler & Another v. J Saunders Ltd (1995) 2 All E.R, 697, to which the Tribunal was referred. Neither does such licensing restrict the powers of the regulatory authorities to control adverse impacts, if any, of such activities.",
            "The Tribunal draws the attention of Parties to the provisions of section 130 of the Environmental Management and Coordination Act, 1999.",
            "Finally, the Tribunal expresses its appreciation to Mr. O. K. Odera, Counsel for the Appellant, Ms. Anne Angwenyi who appeared on behalf of the 1st Respondent, and Mr. Adil Khawaja and Mr. Gitonga Murugara, Counsels for the 2nd Respondent for the diligent manner in which they conducted the matter.",

The plaintiff’s application was certified as urgent on 25th February, 2013 and the plaintiff granted interim injunction pending the hearing of the application interpartes on 7th March, 2013.

After such approval, the Plaintiff prepared building plans which were also approved by the defendants. The Plaintiff thereafter engaged a contractor to put up a barbed wire fence around the suit properties in readiness for the intended development which fence was duly installed by the said contractor.

There is also annexed a note said to be evidence of the sale of the second acre. Also annexed are photographs showing that the plaintiff has built a church building on the suit land.",
            "\tThe defendant upon being served, filed a statement of defence and a counterclaim. In his defence, the defendant has admitted being one of the administrators of the estate of the late Ketinyo. He has also admitted selling one acre of land out of the land parcel L.R.No. 9507 to the plaintiff but has asserted that the plaintiff was awarded 2 acres instead of 1 acre when the grant was confirmed after being hoodwinked into signing the consent on the mode of distribution. The defendant has asserted that the plaintiff unlawfully and illegally took occupation of 2 acres of land instead of the one acre legally sold to the plaintiff. He has denied having harassed the occupation of the land by the plaintiff.",
            "\tIn his counterclaim, the defendant has counterclaimed for one acre of the land from the plaintiff which he has asserted the plaintiff occupies illegally and/or unlawfully. The defendant has averred that the plaintiff has used its position as a religious institution to induce him to surrender an extra one acre. He has counterclaimed for a declaration that the plaintiff is only entitled to one acre and an eviction order to issue against the plaintiff. In the alternative, he has claimed an equivalent of the current market value of one acre to be paid to him.",
            "\tIn his replying affidavit, the defendant has asserted that there was only one agreement of sale for one acre entered into on 31st March 2000 for a consideration of Kshs. 60,000/=and no other agreement. He has acknowledged receipt of Kshs. 92,000/= from the plaintiffs but has stated that this amount reflected the element of interest as the plaintiff paid the money in bits.",
            "\tI have considered the application, the affidavits by both parties, and the submissions of counsel.",
            "\tThe plaintiff's case is that it is entitled to two acres of the suit land and that the defendant has no business interfering in the two acres. It is for this reason that it has sought the prayers in the plaint. I have seen the agreement annexed to the supporting affidavit of the plaintiff and considered the effect of the confirmed grant in Succession Cause No. 135 of 2000.",
            "\t The agreement is one dated 31st March 2000 between the plaintiff and the defendant. The subject matter is one acre out of the land parcel No. L.R No. 9507 at a consideration of Kshs.60,000/=. The agreement states that kshs.60,000/= has been paid leaving a balance of Kshs.20,000/=. Now it cannot be that the consideration for the purchase of one acre could be Kshs.60,000/= and there be a balance of Kshs.20,000/= once an amount of Kshs.60,000/= is received. There must be a problem with the said agreement. The explanation given by the defendant is that the consideration was actually kshs.80,000/= which was erroneously indicated as Kshs. 60,000/=. This does not appear to be denied by the respondent who in the supplementary affidavit has admitted not paying the sum of Kshs. 20,000/= for the first one acre.",
            "\t I have also seen the second note which the plaintiff alleges was reflecting an agreement for a second acre. That note is as follows :-",
            "Addendum Agreement",
            "I Musa Torotich Chepkurui do hereby acknowledge receipt of Kenya Shillings Thirty Five Thousand (Kshs.35,000) from Deliverance Church Board of Trustees through Pastor Isanda being for the payment of the purchase consideration as per the sale agreement of land parcel No. LR 9507 this 20.9.2002.",
            "Signed ",
            "Musa Toroitich Chepkurui  (Signature)",
            "Pastor David Isanda  (Signature).",
            "\tThis memorandum in my view is too ambiguous to support any claim of an agreement to the sale of a second acre. The same does not refer to any particular agreement, either the first agreement of 31 March 2000, or an alleged second agreement. To me, it is merely a note acknowledging payment of money for the purchase of land, but the subject matter of the payment is not clear.",
            "\tIn his affidavit, the plaintiff has alleged that this payment was made in respect to a second agreement for the sale of a second acre. It has alleged to have paid Kshs. 92,000/= so far for this second acre. The defendant denies and has stated that this payment is in respect of the earlier agreement of 31 March 2000. I think on this point, I have to give the benefit of doubt to the defendant. No agreement has been demonstrated by the plaintiff for the sale of a second acre and I cannot assume that there was one in the absence of the same. Neither has the plaintiff stated what the purchase price was for that second acre. I think from the material placed before me at this stage of the proceedings, there is no proof of any purchase of a second acre by the plaintiff.",
            "\tHowever, the plaintiff seems to have been awarded two acres in the confirmed grant. I do not know why the defendant allowed the plaintiff two acres in the confirmed grant rather than allow him one acre if that was their agreement. The explanation offered by the defendant is that he was hoodwinked into signing the consent on distribution of the estate of the deceased. The plaintiff insists that this was because two acres had been sold to it.",
            "\t Now , this suit is not a suit suing the administrators of the estate of Ketinyo to have two acres transferred to it in accordance with the distribution ordered by the court. If the administrators have refused to transfer the two acres as ordered by the succession court, then the remedy of the plaintiff lies in asking the court (either the succession court or this court)  to order the enforcement of that confirmed grant. But this is not the nature of the suit before me. The plaintiff in this suit has asked for specific performance to compel the defendant to transfer two acres to itself. For the plaintiff to succeed, it must sue the administrators of the Estate of Ketinyo and not sue the defendant herein in his own personal capacity.",
            "\tThe obligation to transfer land ordered in a succession matter is the duty of the administrators. As I have pointed out, this suit is not a suit against the administrators but is against the defendant in his personal capacity. The defendant in his personal capacity does not have power to transfer two acres of the suit land to the plaintiff. To sustain such an action, the suit has to be against the administrators of the estate of Ketinyo, and I have seen from the confirmed grant that the Estate is being administered by four people, one Rael Kobil Ketinyo, Jacob Kiprono,  Annah Chepkosgei Kimutai and the defendant. The plaintiff's suit against the defendant in his personal capacity, and which seeks to have the defendant in that capacity transfer the two acres to the plaintiff appears to me to be unmaintainable.",
            "\t As to the order of permanent injunction sought, the same may be sustainable, if the plaintiff demonstrates an entitlement to the 2 acres that it occupies.  I am not sure that the plaintiff is entitled to the same through agreement, for there is no agreement for the second acre. There could however be a case that the plaintiff is entitled to the two acres through transmission, for it is not necessary for a transmission of land to be supported by an agreement for sale. The defendant of course has a counterclaim on this second acre based on the position that there was no sale of the second acre. Again if the counterclaim is solely based on lack of a sale, but does not address the issue of transmission, then there is doubt as to success of  the defendant's case.",
            "\tThis suit no doubt places this court in an awkward and difficult situation as the plaintiff has the benefit of two acres granted in the succession matter but which the defendant contests. I think the correct forum for the defendant's contest to the second acre must lie in rectification of the confirmed grant and not through a counterclaim. So long as it is not rectified, it could very well be that the plaintiff is entitled to the second acre, not because of a sale agreement, but through transmission.",
            "\tThere is serious doubt as to the strength of the plaintiff's case in the absence of an agreement but I am also in doubt as to the case of the defendant in the face of the two acres transmitted to the plaintiff in the succession matter which order still subsists. The defendant has stated that he will apply to set it aside, but until this is done the order subsists.",
            "\tBeing in doubt, I therefore will decide this matter on a balance of convenience. The balance of convenience is in favour of the plaintiff. It has developed a church which is no doubt used by a huge congregation. There will be significant hardship if I am to restrain them from making use of the suit land. In the premises, I will allow the plaintiff to remain in use and occupation of the suit land                                                                  ",
            "\tpending the hearing of this suit. I will however require the plaintiff to make an undertaking in damages to the defendant.",

            "RULING",
            "By Notice of Appeal dated 23rd June, 2005, PHENOM Limited, the Appellant, appealed against the Respondent’s condition on its proposed housing development, which the Respondent conveyed by letter dated 19th October, 2004. The proposed development is a housing project in which the Appellant intends to construct 21 housing units in an eight-storey building on a 0.3035 hectare parcel of land known as Plot No. 209/4902, Riverside Gardens, Riverside Drive, Nairobi.",
            "The Appellant’s grounds of appeal initially were that: through the letter of 19th October, 2004, the Respondent expressed concern that the proposed construction had the potential of causing adverse impacts, especially on the riparian environment, yet, in the Appellant’s view, no activity of the project would cause any adverse impacts; that the City Council of Nairobi has the mandate to approve all developments within the City of Nairobi and had approved Appellant’s proposed construction of 4 storeys above ground level and 3 storeys below and the Respondent had no authority to interfere with, or contradict the City Council’s approval; that the Respondent had, by letter dated 14th January, 2005 approved Appellant’s construction of nine storeys which were subsequently scaled down to 4 floors above and 3 floors below and therefore impacts on the environment should be reduced by the down-scaling; that the world over, highrise and multi-storey dwellings and office blocks are built beside rivers; that there was a seven-storey apartment just two blocks away from the Appellant’s proposed site and the Respondent was unjustly discriminatory and biased against the Appellant in restricting its proposed development to only four storeys above ground level and none below natural ground level; that Kenya’s Parliament approved Sessional Paper No. 3 on the National Housing Policy for Kenya, which proposes government’s facilitation of the production of 158,000 housing units in urban areas; and that the Respondent’s 4th condition contained in its letter dated 25th April, 2005 contradicts the City Council’s approval of construction of seven storeys. The said condition reads:",
            "“The project MUST be scaled down from seven (7) levels to a maximum of four (4) storeys only  from the ground level. Development of three (3) storeys/levels of dwellings below ground level is not permitted. The proponent is to observe the 35% maximum permitted Ground Coverage and 0.75 permitted Plot Ratio specifications for residential developments in Zone 4 of the City Council of Nairobi Development Zones in which the project is located. Besides, development of more than four storeys will not comprise a structure of a scale keeping with those in the surrounding area and, hence not environmentally sound. No residential floor shall be permitted below ground level.”",
            "Subsequently, the Appellants’ grounds of appeal were amended by letter dated 25th July, 2005 which restricted the appeal only to the Respondent’s limitation of Appellant’s construction to 4 floors and its prohibition of Appellant’s construction of residential floors below ground level. Other grounds of appeal were expressly vacated.",
            "The Respondent filed a Reply on 16th August, 2005 in which it was asserted, among other things, that the Respondent has authority to intervene in matters concerning the  Appellant’s proposed construction under Section 58 of the Environmental Management and Co-ordination Act (EMCA) which requires project proponents to conduct environmental impact assessment (EIA), notwithstanding any other licence that the Appellant may have received; that Regulation 4 of the Environmental (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations of 2003 provides that no licensing authority shall issue any licence, permit or approval prior to the issuance of an EIA and that any such licences issued are a nullity; that the Respondent has the mandate to approve projects subject to stipulated conditions to be observed by project proponents in order to facilitate sustainable development and sound environmental management, which is its statutory mandate; that it erred in authorizing the Appellant to construct nine storeys in January, 2005 and subsequently advised the Appellant to scale down the project to four floors; that upon consultation with the City Council of Nairobi, the Respondent was provided with the Council’s approved planning policies and development zones which indicated the Appellant’s proposed site as falling under Zone 4 of the Nairobi Planning Zones; that further, by letter dated March 31, 2005, the City Planning Department of Nairobi City Council verified that the Appellant’s proposed site is located within Planning Zone 4 and was subject to the Council’s Planning Policy of 1979; that the Appellant’s proposed project is contrary to the City Council of Nairobi’s planning policy contained in Minute 24 of 13th May, 1987 which is contained in Nairobi City Commission’s Approved Planning Policies, of 1968-1991 which provides, among other things, that highrise developments in Zone 4 be limited to four floors; that therefore, the City Council’s approval of the Appellant’s building plan on 16th December 2004 allowing the Appellant to construct 7 residential floors was an illegality as it was against zoning policy issued by the same Council and should not be used as a justification to proceed with the project; that based on the foregoing, a review and revision of the Appellant’s EIA Project Report and comments from relevant lead agencies, the Respondent issued an approval letter dated 25th April, 2005, subjecting the Appellant’s proposed development to several conditions, including the condition that the number of floors must not exceed four floors and that no dwelling units should be constructed below ground level; and that since the Appellant was dissatisfied with the Respondent’s condition number 4 limiting construction to only 4 floors and prohibiting construction of dwelling houses below ground level and appealed to the Tribunal, the Respondent did not issue an EIA licence.",
            "Upon request to the Tribunal, Riverside Gardens residents were enjoined to the appeal as interested parties/ intervenor through the law firm of S. Musalia Mwenesi Advocates. The intervenor’s objections to the proposed construction  as elaborated in their comments on the Revised Environmental Impact Assessment Study by Bougainvillaea Limited are that: the Appellant’s development does not respect the stipulated environment and planning regulations; that the proposed project area falls under Zone 4 of the City Planning zones where only a maximum of four storey buildings are  allowed; that the roads in the area would not sustain increased traffic resulting from the Appellant’s construction; that construction of 7 storeys at the proposed site would not be in line with similar developments in the area; that the proposed construction would pose security risks, increase noise and dust during the period of construction; that Appellant did not comply with of the EIA requirements under the Physical Planning Act; and that the Appellant did not obtain change of use approval  prior to obtaining approval of building from Nairobi City Council and therefore City Council’s approval was irregularly obtained.",
            "The Tribunal heard the appeal on seven occasions between September 20th and October 27th, 2005. At the hearing, the Appellant was represented by Mr. Murugara of Hamilton Harrison & Mathews Advocates; the Respondent by Ms. Anne Angwenyi and the Intervenor by Ms. Janet Lavuna and subsequently, Mr. Musalia Mwenesi Advocate, both of Ms. S.Musalia Mwenesi Advocates. A total of six witnesses testified. In support of the Appellant’s case, Mr. Paul Mutahi Wareithi, an architect and designer who prepared the Appellant’s building plan and Ms. Laura Wahome who was, statedly, the Appellant’s EIA expert, testified. In support of the Respondent’s case, Mr. Morris Mbegera, the Respondent’s Director in charge of Compliance and Enforcement testified. For the Intervenor, Mr. George Kibuthu Ndegwa and Mr. David Campbell, both members of Riverside Gardens Residents Association testified.",
            "In addition, Nairobi City Council’s Director of City Planning designated Mr. John Barreh, a town planner and Acting Assistant Director in charge of urban research to the Tribunal, as a friend of the Tribunal, to explain the City Council’s policies, zoning and other regulations and procedures that were applicable.",
            "The Tribunal along with the parties visited the Appellant’s site on September 27, 2005 at the request of counsel for the Appellant.",
            "At the commencement of hearing, Mr. Murugara, counsel for the Appellant, clarified that the Appellant was only appealing against the Respondent’s condition number 4 reproduced in paragraph 3 and that even in relation to that condition, the Appellant had a problem with only a portion, namely, that “the Appellant should scale down construction to four floors only” and that “any storeys below ground level are not permitted.” The Appellant’s counsel explained that the Appellant also sought to demonstrate that it did not intend to construct any dwelling houses underground, strictly speaking, because in actual fact, the construction would be governed by the topography of the land. He further clarified that the Appellant also sought to demonstrate that it had complied with all relevant regulations and that even if NEMA had the power to impose the condition, it could not be complied with in reality. He, therefore, as earlier stated in paragraph 9, invited the Tribunal to visit the site early in its deliberations.",
            "It was the Appellant’s case that the Respondent’s condition that the Appellant constructs only four storeys above ground level and its prohibition of construction of any dwelling units below ground level exceeded and are contrary to requirements of the Local Government Act, Cap 265, and the Physical Planning Act, Cap 286, and is ultra vires the Respondent’s authority under the Environmental Management and Co-ordination Act (EMCA), No. 8 of 1999. In any case, the Appellant maintained, no storeys would, strictly speaking, be constructed below ground level because in actual fact, the Appellant’s construction would be governed by the topography of the land in question, which slopes downward from Riverside Drive (the main entrance) side, to the Nairobi River on the rear. Further, the Appellant reiterated that it had complied with all relevant regulations and that the Respondent had no power to impose a condition on it to construct only four storeys above ground level and that even if the Respondent  had power to impose such a condition, the condition could not be practically complied with.",
            "Witnesses for the Appellant testified that the proposed project site is a parcel of land measuring 0.3035 hectares whose slope is quite steep and drops downward by about 12 metres from the Riverside Drive entrance to Nairobi River on the rear side. They stated that initially, the Appellant proposed to construct nine (9) floors including a duplex but, upon submission of the building plan for approval, Nairobi City Council directed that the project be scaled down to seven floors. It was their evidence that upon scaling down construction plan as directed, the City Council approved their building plan on December 16, 2004 and conveyed its approval by letter dated January 7, 2005. The Appellant’s architect stated that the technical department of Nairobi City Council approves plans and subsequently, they are forwarded to the Council which, in a meeting, approves and subsequently, a letter of approval is sent to a developer.",
            "The City Council’s letter of January 7, 2005 forms part of the Appellant’s bundle and indicates that the Council’s approval of the proposed housing development was subject to two conditions, namely: (a) submission of satisfactory structural details, including lintols and trusses; and (b) all debris and excavated materials to be dumped on sites approved by the City Engineer. The Appellant did not tender any evidence to show that the two conditions were complied with prior to their commencement of construction work.",
            "It was stated by Appellant’s witnesses that subsequent to the City Council’s approval, electrical drawings were prepared and tenders for construction services floated and the firm of Sagar Builders won the bid. Witnesses further stated that on the advice of a structural engineer, the ground on the lower side of the Appellant’s plot was broken to a depth of between 9 and 12 metres to find a solid ground on which to base the foundation of the building. All these were done before the Appellant complied with EIA regulations and it is only after the steps had been taken that the Appellant conducted an EIA through the firm of Bougainvillaea Limited. Upon submission of an EIA Project Report, the Respondent approved construction by letter dated 25th February, 2005 with the condition that the Appellant constructs only four floors and that no dwelling units should be constructed below ground level.",
            "It was contended for the Appellant that the ground level is on the Riverside Drive (entrance) side of the plot and that the Respondent’s condition requires backfilling of an area that slopes up to approximately 12 metres toward the river, which would be very expensive. The Appellant took the position that the ground level is at the Riverside Drive entrance to the plot and that from that level, the proponent proposes to construct four floors above, and three floors below, instead of backfilling. The Appellant maintains that in that situation, there will, in reality, be no floors underground, or below ground level.",
            "Appellant’s witnesses went further to testify that within the 0.3035 hectare plot, the Appellant plans to maintain six (6) metres between windows and the nearest wall. The Appellant will also provide a 1 – 2 metre staircase; an elevator within the building; a parking area for sixty (60) vehicles; a boundary wall between the parking area and the building; a borehole, a swimming pool and an underground water tank. The Appellant’s witnesses explained  that since sitting rooms are, by law, required to be seven metres from any wall, all sitting rooms would face the Nairobi River side of the compound (the lower side). In the architect’s testimony, available space in the Appellant’s proposed site that would accommodate all of the planned developments is 24 x 24 metres on the back side and 24 x 15 metres in front. There was no evidence that the Appellant had considered allowing a play ground for children on the plot and although witnesses stated that the Appellant planned to construct an underground water tank, a bore hole and a swimming pool, its architect was not sure the Appellant had obtained required permits and admitted he had not seen any letter of application or approval.",
            "The Appellant’s architect acknowledged that the proposed construction site falls under Zone 4 of Nairobi City Planning Zones, whose requirements under zoning regulations are a maximum 35% ground coverage and 0.75 plot ratio. He admitted that Nairobi City Council scaled down the proposed number of floors from nine  (9) to seven (7) because when the Council calculated the area allowed for development under the City By-laws, it was found that the Appellant proposed to utilize a larger plot ratio than the ratio allowed. He stated that for the City Council, the ground level is where one enters the building, but witnesses confirmed that  Council officials did not visit the site prior to their approval of the building plan to have a visual impression of its topography. In cross –examination, the architect admitted that without fulfilling the Respondent’s conditions, approval cannot be granted.",
            "On her part, Ms. Laura Wahome who was called to testify as the Appellant’s EIA expert admitted that she has not completed her master’s degree in  environmental studies and is neither qualified, nor registered as an EIA expert with the National Environment Management Authority; that although she prepared the Appellant’s first EIA Project Report and was responsible for advising the Appellant on zoning, she was not, at the time, familiar with the City Council’s zoning regulations and was not aware that buildings in Zone 4 in Nairobi should not exceed four (4) floors; that she had assumed that if the City Council approved the Appellant’s building plan then it had considered all relevant issues; that she was not aware of plinth area and maximum  ground coverage requirements and had not made calculations in accordance with City Council housing regulations; that she was not aware of zoning impacts on the environment until she came to the Tribunal; and that her experience at the Tribunal had been “a steep learning curve.”",
            "The witness for the Respondent, Mr. Mbegera, defended the Respondent’s condition that the Appellant scales down its proposed housing development to a maximum of four floors. It was the witness’s testimony that Section 58 of EMCA requires all developments listed under the Second Schedule to the Act to undergo EIA requirements prior to commencement and that the Appellant’s proposed development falls under the Schedule and required an EIA. Further, he testified that EMCA authorizes the Respondent to ensure that project proponents undertake EIA, subsequent to which an EIA licence may be denied, granted or granted subject to conditions and that it has been the practice of the Respondent in cases where an EIA licence is to be conditioned to first convey necessary conditions to an applicant and if an applicant accepts, a conditional EIA licence is issued.",
            "The witness also testified that after NEMA received the Appellant’s EIA Project Report, it approved construction of nine storeys on 14th January 2005 and admitted that the approval was granted without prior consultation with lead agencies and without consideration of applicable Nairobi City Council’s zoning regulations, or knowledge that zoning restrictions on the proposed project site existed. Counsel for the Respondent admits in written submissions that the approval was unfortunate.",
            "The witness further testified that subsequent to the approval, the Respondent received objections to the proposed development from residents of Riverside Gardens and this prompted it to conduct a public hearing, in the process of which it emerged that there existed City Council zoning regulations and policies which restrict construction of storey buildings in the area to a maximum of four floors. The Respondent was also prompted by residents’ objections to consult with the City Council in the process of which the Council provided its 1979 Zoning Policy, still in force, and Council Minute Number 24 of 13th May, 1987 which place the area of the proposed development under Zone 4 and limits high rise developments to a maximum of four floors, a plot ratio of 0.75 and ground coverage of 35%. The zoning policies and regulations form part of the Respondent’s bundle of response.",
            "It was further stated that upon consultations with lead agencies and consideration of the City Council’s zoning policies and regulations, the Respondent discovered that the Appellant’s proposed development exceeded allowable limits and directed that the Appellant revises its EIA Project Report in consideration of the City Council regulations and resident’s objections. The Respondent’s witness testified that the Respondent subsequently reviewed the Appellant’s revised Project Report in light of existing zoning regulations and policies and on this basis, came to the conclusion that the development had to be scaled down to a maximum of four floors. The Respondent took the position that ground level was at the point of entry to the Appellant’s site, on Riverside Drive side and placed a condition requiring the Appellant to begin construction of four floors from there. It was the Respondent’s testimony that by cutting the ground 8-9 metres deep, the Appellant had created a new ground level and  additional height to accommodate three floors “below the natural ground level” and that this could not be permitted  since in their view, it would adversely affect the human environment. The witness stated that the information the Respondent received after the public meeting was held was that residents of Riverside Gardens did not object to the proposed development, provided that zoning regulations were observed.",
            "Regarding compliance with other relevant laws, the Respondent’s witness maintained that EMCA is a framework law that recognizes the existence of other laws that affect its operations and that the Respondent had the authority to consider those other laws. On the basis of the witness’s testimony, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to uphold its conditions on the proposed development.",
            "The intervenor’s witnesses testified that they are residents of Riverside Gardens where the Appellant intends to develop a high-rise residential building and that they have lived there for a long time in peace and feared that the proposed development would increase traffic, pollution, insecurity and pose other negative environmental impacts. It was also likely to constrain facilities in the area, which were designed for single dwelling houses. If the development was allowed as intended, they maintained, it would also negatively impact on the value of their property. They were concerned that the Appellant had advertised for the sale of twenty six (26) units on a plot previously used for single dwelling without consulting with them prior to commencement of the proposed development and they only managed to know about the project and raise objection with the City Council and the Respondent after the Appellant commenced work.",
            "Witnesses maintained that the Appellant had not complied with applicable building regulations because it had failed to obtain change of use approval for the plot in question from single residence to multi-storey residential premises. It was their testimony that the Physical Planning Act requires public participation in the process of obtaining permission for change of use and that a receipt produced by the Appellant, which was purportedly issued by Nairobi City Council upon application for change of use dated July 20, 2004, yet an advertisement by the City Council of the proposed development, which was purportedly in compliance with public participation requirements of the Physical Planning Act was published on July 21, 2004 in the Daily Nation. In any case, they maintained, the Appellant failed to produce any application for change of use, or letter of authorization of change of use from the Physical Planning Department. Moreover, they maintained, Riverside Gardens residents had not been invited to participate in hearing the Appellant’s application for change of use and were therefore denied a chance to raise objections to the proposed development.",
            "The witnesses further stated that after consulting with NEMA, the City Council and the Physical Planning Department, the Director of Physical Planning of the Ministry of Lands wrote a letter dated 9th November, 2004 to the Council pointing out that there already exists a borehole in the neighbourhood and that construction of another borehole as proposed by the Appellant would have negative impacts on the environment; that the development was likely to have adverse impacts on land and other types of environment in the area, that the proposed development would impact heavily on existing infrastructure; that views of local residents should be taken into consideration; that the City Council needed to consider its planning policies before approving the proposed development; and that the proposed development needed to be discussed with the Physical Planning Liaison Committee as provided in section 10(2) of the Physical Planning Act. A copy of the letter forms part of the bundle submitted by the intervenor. In the witnesses’ view, the letter had nearly concluded that the proposed development was not approvable and they were surprised to see that the Appellant had commenced work.",
            "Issues for the Tribunal to consider were as follows: whether the Respondent had authority to subject the Appellant’s proposed housing development to conditions; whether the Respondent’s condition Number 4 can be maintained; whether Nairobi City Council has zoning policies and regulations applicable to the Appellant’s development; whether the Appellant complied with relevant regulations, including the requirement that a change of use approval be obtained prior to converting the plot from a single dwelling house to multi-storey  residential housing units; whether the Appellant complied with requirements for obtaining change of use approval; whether the Appellant complied with the regulations; whether the Appellant’s building plan for the proposed housing development was legally approved by the City Council; whether the Appellant can proceed with construction of 7 floors as proposed; and who pays costs of the appeal.",
            "Mr. John Barreh, a city planner and Acting Assistant  Director of Urban Research at Nairobi City Council who was  designated by the Director of City Planning to testify on the Council’s zoning policies and regulations, as well as its procedures for approval of building plans also gave evidence as amicus curiae. He testified that the Council does have zoning and planning policies and regulations. He explained that the first Master Plan of the City was developed in 1948 and that by 1979, the City was zoned in a way that Westlands and Kileleshwa areas, including the Appellant’s land, fell under Zone 4 which was designated as a residential area, with a minimum plot size of ¼ of an acre, serviced on site and that most of the plots in the area were sewered. Council regulations also limited the amount of land to be developed in each plot to a vertical plot ratio of 0.75 (of plots of ¼ of an acre), meaning that one could only develop a total of 750 square metres of ¼-acre plot.  Development would then cover a maximum of 35% of ground with the remainder of development to be taken up (vertically). At the time, flats and masionettes were allowed but subject to allowable plot ratio and maximum ground coverage. In addition, one was required to obtain a change of use approval from the Ministry of Lands and the City Council in case a developer wished to construct buildings for purposes other than single dwelling in parcels of land that were used for single dwelling.",
            "Mr. Barreh explained that the situation prevailed until 1987 when, in a meeting of the City Council’s Works and Planning Committee, it was proposed that high rise developments be permitted in zone 4, but that they be limited to four floors and that the developments (the four floors) be limited to a maximum of 10% ground coverage and a plot ratio of 0.25. He explained that the proposal was confirmed by City Commission (as it then was) Minute Number 24 of 13th May, 1987. The Minutes are contained in a document titled “Nairobi City Commission, City Planning and Architecture Department, Commission Approved Planning Policies, 1988-1991.” ",
            "Mr. Barreh further explained that the Council policy, which was in operation by 1988, limited sizes of sewered plots in Zone 4 to 0.05 hectare (down from 0.1 hectare) and unsewered plots were to remain at a minimum of 0.2 hectare. It also permitted highrise developments in sewered areas with a maximum of four floors, with developments limited at 10% ground coverage and plot ratio of 0.25. He stated that those are the limits applicable to the Appellant’s proposed development. He explained that since he joined the City Council in 1988, the practice has been to limit developments in zone 4 to 35% of ground coverage, with a plot ratio of 0.75, even though there is nothing authorizing the increase, which in itself is a departure from the 1987 policy. To him, these are administrative changes. The position is confirmed by a letter from the Director of City Planning, Mr. F.M. Ndereba to the Provincial Commissioner, Nairobi in reference to the Appellant’s property dated 31st March, 2005. The letter forms part of the Respondent’s bundle of Reply. Further he explained that regarding the number of floors allowed in Zone 4, the Council has adopted the British system with reference to four storeys (rather than floors) which, in effect, amount to five floors, including the ground floor.",
            "Mr. Barreh explained that zoning caters for the physical and the human environment, which is why the City Council has requirements for room of 2.4 meters to be maintained between bedrooms and outside walls and ground coverage of 35% to allow landscaping and ventilation and that even drainage systems are designed based on a particular population. He stated that the issue of environmental sustainability is factored into zoning regulations.",
            "Mr. Barreh applied the regulations to the Appellant’s proposed development and explained that since the Appellant’s plot has been indicated to be 0.3035 hectare, the area that can be developed, i.e, the plinth area, is 2276 square metres, taking into consideration 0.75 plot ratio. If an additional 10% of plinth area is allowed, as is the administrative practice of the Council, the maximum area the Appellant could be allowed to develop is 2504 square metres. Mr. Barreh explained that to the contrary, the Council, by Minute 13 (No. 25) of the Town Planning Committee of 16th December, 2004, approved the Appellant’s building plan in respect of L.R. No. 209/4902, with a plinth area of 4,370 square metres. Therefore, the building plan was approved with an excess area of 1,866 square metres, a plinth area that is almost double what the Appellant could be permitted to develop in Zone 4. Mr. Barreh said that he had been unable to trace a comment sheet that should have accompanied the Appellant’s application for approval of building plan. He explained that in his view, the approval of the development plan with an excess plinth area was irregular. Mr. Barreh emphasized that had he been the one considering the Appellant’s application, he would not have approved the building plan as presented, because the excess plinth area was contrary to the City Council’s zoning and building regulations and policies.",
            "Mr. Barreh submitted the City Council’s Minute book titled, “City Council of Nairobi, Minutes of Proceedings of the Council and Several Committee Meetings Thereof for the months of November, December 2004 and January, February, March 2005, Volume LXIX, No. 2” and pointed out that on page 883 (item 25), under Minute 18, the Appellant’s building plan was indicated to have been tabled before the Council by a councillor and not a member of the Town Planning Committee as required. He stated that it is unprocedural for councilors to table such technical matters and this could explain why the building plans were approved with excess plinth area, plot ratio and number of floors. In any case, he explained, the Council’s approval of the Appellant’s building plan was “...subject to... the technical officers ensuring that all planning by-laws requirements and also the conditions listed under Minute 7 above had been complied with” as stated by the Council on page 884 of the Minutes. Minute 7 on page 728 requires, among other things, compliance with the Council’s zoning policies and approval of change of use from single dwelling units to multi-family dwelling units.",
            "Mr. Barreh further stated that he had also not seen a change of use application which ought to have been applied for and obtained by the Appellant prior to its application for approval of building plan and that an approval of change of use comes first. He stated that without a change of use, approval of the building plan is not valid.",
            "Mr. Barreh explained that an application for change of use is a separate application which goes to the planning implementation section.  The Appellant did not provide evidence to show that a change of use application was made and approval granted except for uncertified copy of a receipt dated 20th July, 2004 purportedly obtained from the City Council. He explained that a change of use application must comply with requirements of Section 36 of the Physical Planning Act and other enabling provisions of law, which require public participation in the process of considering an application for change of use. He stated that the process requires a public notification of the application to allow comments. Further, he stated that in considering a change of use application, the visual impact of the proposed development on neighbouring property and objections raised by owners of neighbouring property must be taken into consideration. Since he had not seen the Appellant’s application for change of use, he could not say much about it. He also observed that the City Council had approved the Appellant’s building plan without an EIA licence and in his view, that happened because the Council had not taken into consideration the requirements of the Environmental Management and Co-ordination and the Physical Planning Acts.",
            "Mr. Barreh further testified that while perusing the building file, he came across another plan submitted by the developer on 25th January, 2005, requesting an approval for alteration and extension to add two (2) more floors to be approved.  This is Plan No. DW 850 and proposes an additional plinth area of 830 square metres.  This alteration and extension proposal for additional 2 floors could not be approved by the Council, since the initial building plan was already in excess of what should have been approved.",
            "Mr. Barreh testified that when he visited the site for the proposed development he noted that the natural ground level had been interfered with.  The ground was not naturally inclining towards the river and indeed had been mechanically cut to about 8-9 meters deep to create a new ground level.  He testified that such mechanical cutting is allowed in design but the architect is required to clearly show the proposed cutting in the building plans so that it can be approved together with the building plans, thus enabling the Council to make an informed decision.  He further stated that when making such a cut, one can take advantage of the sloping/gradient of the land, but one must maintain the plinth area at all times.  In fact for the present development, the architect had not clearly shown this mechanical cut and indeed the impression created by the building plans/architectural designs was that this was the natural slope of the land.  He further stated that in approving the building plans, the most exposed view of the building would be taken to be the ground level.  In this instance the ground level would be taken to be the rear of the building (the view from the river).  He further testified that it was not necessary to cut the ground that deep as this is red soil and it is not required for one to hit the hard rock.",
            "He concluded that the proposed development would not match the character of the area as zoned by the Council and that the buildings should be uniform at least in height to conform to what is envisaged in Zone 4 of the City planning zones.",
            "In consideration of the issues, the Tribunal relies on the evidence of  witnesses of the  Appellant, Respondent and the intervener as well as  evidence adduced by Mr. John Barreh  as a friend of the Tribunal and all applicable laws and policies and finds as follows on the pertinent issues arising:",
            "The Respondent is a governmental agency that has authority under section 58 of the Environmental Management and Co-ordinations Act (EMCA), the Environmental (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations 4, 31 ( Legal Notice No. 101 of 2003) and other enabling provisions of law, to require proponents of projects listed under the Second Schedule of EMCA to prepare environmental impact assessment study  project reports. Upon review of EIA reports, the Respondent has authority to deny approval of a project, approve a project or approve a project subject to such conditions that it deems necessary to prevent and/or reduce negative environmental impacts that might result from an activity. In law, the environment has been broadly defined, particularly in section 2 of EMCA to include the physical factors of surroundings of human beings, including land, water, social factors of aesthetics as well as the natural and the built environment. Therefore, clearly, the Respondent has authority to regulate the Appellant’s proposed activity and place conditions as necessary to protect the environment. For this reason, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent did not act ultra vires in placing conditions on the Appellant’s proposed development.",
            "Regarding the validity of the conditions placed on the Appellant’s development by the Respondent to limit its development to four floors without any dwellings below ground level, the Tribunal presents its findings on three critical issues, namely: (i) Where exactly is the ground level of the Appellant’s plot? (ii) How much space on its plot is the Appellant allowed by the City Council policies and regulations to develop? And (iii) was the City Council’s approval of the Appellant’s building plan lawful?",
            "Witnesses for the Appellant did not clarify the Appellant’s position on the ground level, or what the Appellant perceives to be the ground level for approval purposes, even though the Appellant’s building plan indicates that its ground floor would be at the ground level on the lower (River) side. No evidence was adduced by the Appellant to show that the City Council officials who approved its building plan visited the proposed site prior to their approval and Mr. Barreh, the Council official who testified as amicus curiae confirmed that Council officials often do not visit sites before approving building plans. Without their proper appreciation of the topography, one would not expect a clear determination by the Council of what is the ground level of the Appellant’s property. For the Respondent, evidence was tendered that in its prohibition of construction of dwelling houses below ground level, it took the view that ground level is at the entrance to the Appellant’s property, on Riverside Drive side.",
            "Further, Mr. Barreh testified that when he visited the site, he found that the natural ground had been cut up to between 8.1 and 9 metres deep and the Appellant’s architect, Mr. Paul Mutahi Wareithi, admitted that the ground was cut  9-12 metres deep on the Appellant’s structural engineer’s advice that they should cut it until they find a solid ground on which to base the building foundation. This had therefore interfered with the natural ground topography that led to the dispute as to what the ground level was at different points, and particularly at the upper Riverside road, and at the lower (River) side. On the basis that the ground had been extensively cut and that construction would begin with the lower (River) side as the ground level, which as Mr. Barreh emphasized (para 37 above), “the most exposed view of the building would be taken as the  ground level,” the Tribunal finds that the ground level is on the lower side. In the circumstances, there would, in reality and in the Tribunal’s finding, be no dwelling houses below ground level as full view of the buildings would be visible by residents across the river and on two sides except the Riverside road.",
            "In addressing the issue of how much space the Appellant is allowed to develop ( (ii) paragraph 41 above) and therefore, how many floors, the Tribunal proceeds from the position that the determining  ground level is on the lower side. From that level, the Tribunal considers City Council building policies and zoning regulations and how much of a plot they allow to be developed in Zone 4. Appellant’s architect, Mr. Paul Wareithi, admitted that the Appellant acknowledges that its plot number 209/4902 on which it proposes the development in question falls under Zone 4. Further, the witness for the Respondent and the Council official who testified as amicus curiae gave evidence and official documents, plans and maps showing that the City Council has, a building policy and building regulations, including City Council minutes, which limit housing developments in zone 4 to a maximum of four floors, taking into consideration a maximum 35% ground coverage, 0.75 plot ratio and an additional 10% plinth area which the Council administratively allows. In consideration of these development limitations, the Tribunal finds that with a plot whose size is 0.3035 hectare (or 3035 square metres of land), the Appellant can only develop 2276 square metres. Therefore, the number of floors the Appellant can construct must not exceed four (4) floors and must cover a maximum of 2504 square metres (including 10% allowed by administrative practice), beginning on the lower side. The Tribunal notes that the fact that the plinth area approved far exceeds permissible limits was not contested as explained by the Appellant who had admittedly received more deposits from potential buyers than the 21 or 26 house units would accommodate.  No doubt starting the project before pertinent permits and licenses were obtained would put the proponent into expenses and difficulties but this is the risk they took and the consequences they inevitably have to endure.                         ",
            "The Tribunal’s finding in paragraph 44, on (ii) above, leads to the conclusion that the City Council’s approval of the Appellant’s building plan was not lawful for the reason that the plan was approved with a plinth area of 4,370 square metres, which far exceeds 2504 square metres which should have been allowed, at a maximum, taking into consideration Council regulations and policies which limit ground coverage, plot ratio and number of floors in zone 4. Moreover, the Appellant failed to produce any credible evidence to show that it obtained approval of change of use of the plot from single dwelling to multi-storey residential houses, which the law requires prior to obtaining the Council’s approval of building plans. Further, the Tribunal notes that it was irregular for the Appellant’s building plan to be tabled before the Council by a councillor and not a member of the Town Planning Committee thus important technical considerations were glossed over and not properly dealt with. Plainly speaking, technical work should first be done by those charged with that responsibility and not by political officials as was the case in this matter.",
            "Regarding the claim that NEMA’s limitation of the Appellant’s development contradicts the City Council’s approval of the Appellant’s building plan, the Tribunal finds that under EMCA and the regulations made thereunder, particularly Sections 58, 68 and 148 and Regulations 4 and 31 of the Environmental (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations of 2003, the requirements of EMCA on the Appellant, as well as the Respondent’s authority supercede those of the City Council and any action the Council may have taken regarding the proposed development. The Tribunal notes that the Physical Planning Act requires an EIA, prior to obtaining a change of use approval. However, there was no evidence that the Appellant complied with the Physical Planning Act’s requirement of EIA and for that reason too, the EIA process conducted by the Appellant forms a proper basis on which the Respondent could take action on the Appellant’s proposed development as authorized by law. In any case, the Respondent’s witness adduced evidence to the effect that the Respondent consulted with lead agencies, including the City Council, to ensure that a sound decision devoid of inconsistencies was made, prior to placing limitations on the Appellant’s proposed development. For these reasons, the argument that there are regimes for approval of building plans in other legislation that EMCA should not interfere with is not tenable.",
            "For the reasons explained, the Tribunal unanimously  finds that the appeal fails and directs that:",
            "The Appellant re-draws the building plan to conform to allowable ground coverage of not more than 35% of the plot, a plot ratio of 0.75 and a maximum of four floors, starting from the river side ground level before re-submitting the revised plan to Nairobi City Council for approval.",
            " Once satisfied that 1 above is fulfilled, NEMA would be at liberty to issue an EIA licence to the Appellant in accordance with applicable zoning and building regulations and policies.",
            "48. The Tribunal has been asked to award costs.  The Tribunal acknowledges that this particular",
            "appeal was a learning process for parties and orders each party to bear its own costs.",
            "49. The Tribunal wishes to express its profound appreciation to the Director of City",
            "Planning for designating Mr. John Barreh who professionally and competently informed the Tribunal on all points raised with him.",
            "50. The Tribunal draws Appellant’s attention to Section 130 of EMCA.",

Andande.\n\nIssues:\n\n\ti) Whether the wife could get a share in the matrimonial property at the dissolution of marriage despite not contributing to its acquisition.\n\n\tii) Whether the wife upon being registered as a joint owner of the suit property acquired absoluteownership thereof.\n\nConstitutional law –  fundamental rights and freedoms – right toequality – equality in distribution of matrimonial property – where the wife had not contributed towards acquisition of the property – whether the constitutional provision on equality in distribution of matrimonial property could be applied in the circumstances – Constitution of Kenya, 2010, articles 2(5), 45(3).\n\nLand law – joint tenancy – absolute ownership - registration of land in joint names – where the husband registered the property in joint names with his wife – implication of registering property as joint tenants – whether the husband could later rightfully purport to be the sole owner of the property - Land Registration Act, section 24 (b).\n\nInternational law – rights of women – non discrimination of women - equality in distribution of matrimonial property at dissolution of marriage – whether the wife was entitled to a share in the matrimonial property despite not contributing to its acquisition – the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 16(1) - the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights, article 7 (d) - the International Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination Against Women article 6 (1) (h).\n\n\tThe Constitution of Kenya, 2010 provides as follows in article 45 (3):-\n\n“Parties to a marriage are entitled to equal rights at the time of the marriage, during the marriage and at the dissolution of the marriage”\n\n\tArticle 2 (5) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 provides as follows:-\n\n“The general rules of international law shall form part of the Law of Kenya”\n\n\tArticle 16 (1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states as follows:-\n\n\t“Married Women of full age without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion have the right to marry and to found a family.  They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage during marriage and at its dissolution”\n\n\tArticle 7 (d) of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights states:-\n\n\t“In cases of Separation, divorce or annulment of marriage, women and men shall have the right to an equitable sharing of the property deriving from the marriage”\n\n\tArticle 6 (1) (h) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination Against Women provides that State Parties are enjoined:-\n\n“To ensure on the basis of equality the same rights for both spouses in respect of the ownership, acquisition, management, administration, enjoyment and disposing of property whether free of charge or for valuable consideration.”\n\n\tLand Registration Act, Section 24(a) provides:-\n\n“Subject to this Act, the registration of a person as the proprietor of land shall vest in that person the absolute ownership of that land together with all rights and privileges belonging or appurtenant thereto”.\n\nHeld:\n\n\t1. The provisions of international law were part of the laws of Kenya by Virtue of article 2 (5) of the Constitution and augmented article 45(3) of the Constitution. The provisions pointed to the equality of both a man and his wife or if divorced, ex-wife and required that the principle of equality be applied in the division of matrimonial property.\n\n\t2. The constitutional provisions enshrining the principle of equality when it came to distribution of matrimonial property had primacy over the principle of law enunciated by the decision in Echaria vs. Echaria which stemmed from an ordinary legislation. This was because the principle of law set by the court in Echaria vs. Echaria stemmed from provisions of a legislationwhich was subordinate to constitutional provisions. (Z.W.N. v. P.N.N. Civil suit No. 10 of 2004).\n\n\t3. Despite the fact that the plaintiff had solely met all the costs of acquiring the property, the legal landscape had since changed so that it was no longer a question of how much each spouse had contributed towards the purchase of a matrimonial property that mattered. The legal provisions in force required the court to apply the principle of equality in all instances.  The court was thus duty bound to share the suit property equally between the Plaintiff and the Defendant.\n\n\t4. By registering the defendant as the joint owner of the suit property, the defendant acquired, jointly with the plaintiff, absolute ownership in the suit property that could not be challenged or simply wished away. The plaintiff thus gifted the defendant a half share in the suit property and such a gift could not be taken away from her.\n\nSuit dismissed and the counter-claim allowed save that each party to bear their own costs.\n",

            "The Plaintiff filed suit by way of a Plaint dated 23rd April, 2012 in which he sought for Judgment to be entered in his favour as follows:-",
            "a)   A declaration that the property known as Nairobi /Block [particulars withheld]  (hereinafter referred to as the “Suit Property”) was acquired and developed through the Plaintiff’s sole effort.",
            "b)   A declaration that the Defendant did not make any contribution financial or otherwise to the acquisition and development of the Suit Property and is not entitled to a share of the Suit Property.",
            "c)   An order that the entry at the Nairobi Lands Office relating to the Suit Property be amended to remove, alter, amend and exclude the name of the Defendant herein.",
            "d)   Costs of this Suit",
            "e)   Any other or further relief that this Honourable Court may deem fit and just to grant.",
            "FACTS",
            "The Plaintiff purchased the Suit Property from Continental Developers Limited in the year 1989. Continental Developers Limited informed him that they could build him a house on the Suit Property at a total cost of Ksh. 520,000/-. The Plaintiff was asked to pay 25% of the purchase price as deposit. At this time, the Plaintiff was working for [particulars withheld] East Africa Limited. He had just joined this Company from [particulars withheld] where he had a sum of Ksh. 130,000/- being his providentfunds dues.He collectedhis provident fund dues  amounting to Ksh. 130,000/- and paid the same to Continental Developers Limited as the deposit for the Suit Property. All this while, the Plaintiff was married to the Defendant, their Marriage having been solemnized on 3rd September 1988. Thereafter, the Plaintiff approached Housing Finance Company of Kenya Limited (“HFCK”) for a mortgage of the remaining balance of Ksh. 390,000/-.",
            "To qualify for the said mortgage, the Plaintiff had to show that he was earning more than Ksh. 10,000/- per month in salary. The Plaintiff qualified. His loan application was duly approved by Housing Finance Company of Kenya Limited to be repaid through monthly deductions from his salary earned from his employment with [particulars withheld] Brothers East Africa Limited. The Loan was to be repaid within a period of 18 years. When the Plaintiff applied for the mortgage facility at Housing Finance Company of Kenya Limited, the manager there advised him that it was wise to include the name of his wife in the Suit Property which advice he complied with. The Loan facility was then Utilized by Continental Developers Limited in the construction of a three bed roomed residential house known as House Number [particulars withheld] DonholmTena Estate and upon completion, the Plaintiff and his family took possession andstarted living there from the year 1991. In 1996, the Defendant left the Plaintiff and got married to one P.M.K. The Plaintiff then filed for divorce which proceedings culminated in dissolution of their marriage on 8th October, 1998. By this time, the Plaintiff had four children being the issues from his marriage with Defendant. After dissolution of their marriage, the Plaintiff continued to pay the mortgage on the Suit Property until November 2005 when the last payment was made.",
            "The Plaintiff also ensured he paid all the Land Rents, Land Rates and all other requisite payments on water, electricity, insurance, and security relating to the Suit Property. For the entire period the Plaintiff went through the process of paying the mortgage, the Defendant did not offer him any financial contribution to the same. The Plaintiff was also solely responsible to take care of the upbringing of his four children after the Defendant departed.

            " Arising from these facts, the Plaintiff is of the opinion that it is only right and fair that the ownership of the Suit property that currently reflects joint ownership be amended and reviewed to reflect the correct and true position that he is the sole and absolute owner of the Suit Property.",

            "“This court notes and appreciates that the principle of law set by the Court in Echariav.Echaria stems from provisions of the legislation subordinate to constitutional provisions, meaning that the constitutional provisions enshrining the principle of equality when it comes to distribution of matrimonial property have primacy over the principle of law enunciated by the decision in Echaria v.

            "Case Summary:": "\nReported by Nelson.K.Tunoi & Beatrice Manyal.\n\nIssues:\n\n\ti. Whether a suit to remove a caution could be instituted by way of a miscellaneous application.\n\n\tii. What was the procedure of removing a caution in a court of law?\n\nLand law-cautions- removal of a caution-the procedure of removal of cautions -applicant seeking to have a caution lodged by respondent removed-suit instituted by way of miscellaneous application -respondent raising preliminary objection that suit was incompetent- whether suit to remove caution could be instituted by way of miscellaneous application- where there was no provision in law for such suit to be instituted by way of miscellaneous application or by way of originating summons -Land Registration Act sections 71, 73,\n\nHELD;\n\n\t1. Section 71 of the Land Registration Act provides that a caution may be lodged by a person who claims the right to obtain an interest in land capable of creation by an instrument registrable under the statute. A caution may also be lodged by a person claiming entitlement to a license or by a person who has presented a bankruptcy petition against the proprietor.\n\n\t2. Under section 73 of the Land Registration Act, cautions could be removed in three ways; by withdrawal of the same by the cautioner, by removal by order of the court and by removal by order of the registrar. These three ways were independent of each other such that it was not necessary for one to demonstrate that he had attempted to have the caution removed by the Land Registrar before moving the court to remove the caution.\n\n\t3. It is apparent that in this matter, the respondent had placed a caution in the title of the suit land claiming a purchaser’s interest. The applicant’s application to the Registrar to have the caution removed was not successful and therefore the applicant sought the intervention of court to have the caution removed.\n\n\t4. Under Section 19 of the Civil Procedure Act, every suit had to be instituted in such manner as may be prescribed by Rules. The Civil Procedure Rules did not have a monopoly on how suits should be instituted as there could be Rules in other statutes on how proceedings may be commenced.\n\n\t5. In cases where there was no “action”, The Civil Procedure Rules did not specifically provide for the procedure to be followed, therefore it was permissible to file a miscellaneous application because the court was not tasked with determining any issues between the parties.\n\n\t6. Where there is a call to adjudicate on rights of parties then it must be said that there is a “civil action” and this had to be commenced in the manner prescribed by the Rules.  A matter touching on whether or not a caution needs to be removed was a civil action which then had to be commenced in the manner prescribed by the Rules as it was a contentious issue that had to be tried on merits.\n\n\t7. The Land Registration Act did not prescribe any rules on how proceedings under the statute need to be commenced. In this event, the default statute remained the Civil Procedure Act. Order 3 Rule 1 specifically provided that “every suit shall be instituted by presenting a plaint to the court, or in such other manner as may be prescribed.”\n\n\t8. Originating Summons under Order 37 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 was not applicable to all suits but limited to only suits of a special nature which Order 37 specified. The removal of a caution was not one of the specified matters in which applications could be made by way of Originating Summons.\n\n\t9. An action for the removal of a caution therefore had to be commenced by way of Plaint in which suit the plaintiff had to prove on a balance of probabilities why the defendant had no right to place the caution on his title and why the caution placed by the defendant had to be removed.\n\n\t10. The purpose of having Rules of procedure was to have proceedings controlled in a logical sequence so that justice could be done to all parties. It was incumbent upon parties and counsels to follow the procedures laid out. This of course did not imply that a court did not have the discretion to permit some sort of deviation especially where the deviation was minimal and no prejudice caused to the other party.\n\nMiscellaneous application struck out with costs. \n",

            "RULING",
            "A. BACKGROUND",
            "This ruling is in respect of a preliminary objection raised by the respondent. The Notice of Preliminary Objection filed on 16 February 2013 raises two grounds as follows :-",
            "(a) That there is no suit properly before court for determination.",
            "(b) That the suit has been commenced through unprocedural means and is thus fatally defective.",
            "The process herein was commenced by way of a Notice of Motion dated 25 January 2013 stated to be brought under the provisions of Order 51 Rule 1, Section 73 (1) of the Land Registration Act (Act No.3), of 2012, Section 3A and 63 (e) of the Civil Procedure Act and all enabling provisions of the law. The application sought the following orders :-",
            "1.That this application be certified urgent and an earlier (sic) hearing dated (sic) be allocated.",
            "2. That the caution lodged against the land parcel No. Baringo/ Kewamoi A/3241 by the respondent herein be and is hereby removed.",
            "3. That the cost of this application be provided for.",
            "The application is based on the grounds :-",
            "1.That the applicant is the registered owner of that parcel of land known as parcel No. Baringo/Kewamoi A/ 3241 measuring 0.3 hectares or thereabouts.",
            "2. That the respondent has illegally and unlawfully lodged a caution on the said parcel of land thereby preventing the applicant transferring it to his children.",
            "3.That the caution has no merit and is intended to frustrate the applicant from dealing with his parcel of land.",
            "4. That the plaintiff requires that his land be dis-encumbered to enable him enjoy his rights under the law.",
            "5. That the respondent will not suffer any prejudice if the caution is removed.",
            "The application is supported by the affidavit of the applicant. The affidavit is a lengthy one and I do not wish to set it out in full. It is deponed that the applicant is the registered owner of the land parcel Baringo/Kewamoi A/3241 and a copy of the title deed is annexed. He has deponed that at sometimes in 2009, he did enter into a sale agreement with the respondent for the sale of a portion of the suit land which the applicant later repudiated. Owing to this development, the respondent on 26 September 2012, placed a caution on the suit land claiming a purchaser’s interest. The applicant wrote to the Land Registrar advising him that he had rescinded the agreement and asked him to remove the caution. The Land Registrar issued a 30 days notice to the respondent on 3 October 2012 informing him that he would remove the caution unless the respondent made a written objection. The respondent did make an objection on 12 November 2012 which the applicant claims to have been made out of the time frame prescribed by the Land Registrar. The applicant has deponed that he then requested the Registrar to convene a meeting for a hearing on the removal of the caution but the Registrar declined and instead referred the matter to the area Chief thereby abdicating his duties. The applicant has deponed that he does not see how the area Chief can solve a matter involving the removal of a caution which is within the purview of the Land Registrar. It is for this reason that he has now come to court for the caution to be lifted.",
            "The respondent upon being served with the application did not make a reply to it but filed the preliminary objection noted earlier.",
            "B. ARGUMENTS OF COUNSELS",
            "The objection was argued before me on 18/2/ 2013 and 20/2/2013. Mr. T. Mutei, learned counsel for the respondent argued that the applicant could not commence this suit through the provisions of Order 51 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules. He argued that Order 51 presupposes the existence of a suit upon which an application may be filed. He accepted that under the provisions of Section 73 of the Land Registration Act,[1] the court has jurisdiction to remove a caution. However, he stated that this can only be done by the applicant filing an Originating Summons under the provisions of Order 37 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 . He argued that the applicant does not have any suit before the court and that the Notice of Motion is fatally defective. He relied upon the case of Peter Mwema Kahoro & Another vs Benson Maina Githethuki,[2]to support his arguments.",
            "Mr. M.K. Chebii, learned counsel for the applicant argued that the Notice of Motion is properly before court. He stated that the application only asks for the court to remove a caution and that there is no substantive prayer in the application to go for a hearing. He stated that Order 37 of the Civil Procedure Rules does not provide for the procedure for the removal of cautions. According to Mr. Chebii, a suit can be instituted in any manner, “even by writing of a letter”. To him, the preliminary objection was raising a matter of technicality. He pointed out that the substantive law on the removal of cautions is Section 73 (1) of the Land Registration Act[3], but which statute does not provide for the procedure by which the court may be moved. Counsel argued that the removal of a caution is not a substantive issue to warrant one institute suit by way of Plaint or by way of Originating Summons. He argued that the court can determine the issues raised through the application.",
            "C. CONSIDERATION BY COURT",
            "I have considered the Preliminary Objection. The specific issue herein is whether the applicant could commence proceedings on a removal of a caution by way of a Miscellaneous Application. There is also the general question on how proceedings ought to be instituted in court.",
            "Cautions are provided for in the Land Registration Act[4]. Under Section 71 a caution may be lodged by a person who claims the right to obtain an interest in land capable of creation by an instrument registrable under the statute. A caution may also be lodged by a person claiming entitlement to a licence or by a person who has presented a bankruptcy petition against the proprietor. The essence of a caution is to forbid the registration of dispositions in the subject land because the cautioner is apprehensive that such registration may obliterate his interest in the land. Cautions are registered by the Land Registrar.[5]",
            "Section 73 of the Land Registration Act makes provision for the removal or withdrawal of a caution. This section provides as follows :-",
            "73. (1) A caution may be withdrawn by the cautioner or removed by order of the court or, subject to subsection (2), by order of the Registrar.",
            "(2) The Registrar, on the application of any person interested, may serve notice on the cautioner warning the cautioner that the caution will be removed at the expiration of the time stated in the notice.",
            "(3) If a cautioner has not raised any objection at the expiry of the time stated, the Registrar may remove the caution.",
            "(4) If the cautioner objects to the removal of the caution, the cautioner shall notify the Registrar, in writing, of the objection within the time specified in the notice, and the Registrar shall, after giving the parties an opportunity of being heard, make such order as the Registrar considers fit, and may in the order provide for the payment of costs.",
            "(5) After the expiry of thirty days from the date of the registration of a transfer by a chargee in exercise of the chargee’s power of sale under the law relating to land, the Registrar shall remove any caution that purports to prohibit any dealing by the chargee that was registered after the charge by virtue of which the transfer has been effected.",
            "(6) On the withdrawal or removal of a caution, its registration shall be cancelled, and any liability of the cautioner previously incurred under section 74 shall not be affected by the cancellation.",
            "Thus cautions may be removed in three ways.",
            "(a) By withdrawal of the same by the cautioner.",
            "(b) By removal by order of the court.",
            "(c) By removal by order of the Registrar.",
            "These three ways are independent of each other such that it is not necessary for one to demonstrate that he has attempted to have the caution removed by the Land Registrar before moving the court to remove the caution. It is however always advisable to have the court arbitrate the matter as a last recourse.",
            "It is apparent that in this matter, the respondent placed a caution in the title of the suit land claiming a purchaser’s interest. The applicant’s application to the Registrar to have the caution removed was not successful and therefore the applicant has now sought the intervention of court to have the caution removed.",
            "The issue at hand is whether the applicant commenced his action appropriately by filing a Miscellaneous Application. Indeed, is there a valid suit before this court?",
            "I need not overemphasize that it is important to note that the Rules prescribed when instituting a suit need to be followed. But what is a “suit”? ",
            "The word “suit” has several meanings. Black’s Law Dictionary[6] defines “suit” as any proceedings by a party or parties against another in a court of law.[7] “suit of a civil nature” is defined to be a civil action.[8] “A civil action” is an action brought to enforce, redress, or protect a private or civil right.[9]",
            "Section 2 of the Civil Procedure Act, defines “suit” as all civil proceedings commenced in any manner prescribed.[10]",
            "\t“prescribed” under Section 2 means prescribed by rules.[11]",
            "\t“Rules”   means rules and forms made by the Rules Committee to regulate the procedure of courts.[12]",
            "“pleadings” includes a petition or summons, and the statements in writing of the claim or demand of any plaintiff, and of the defence of any defendant thereto, and of the reply of the plaintiff to any defence or counterclaim of a defendant.[13]",
            "Under Section 19 of the Civil Procedure Act, every suit shall be instituted in such manner as may be prescribed by rules. It will be observed that Section 19 does not pretend that the Civil Procedure Rules have a monopoly on how suits should be instituted. It provides that suits may be instituted in the manner prescribed by rules. There could be rules in other statutes on how proceedings may be commenced. For example the Probate & Administration Rules under the Succession Act,[14] prescribe how matters touching on succession of estates of deceased persons need to be instituted.",
            "It means therefore that where a person is commencing a civil suit ( in this instance to enforce a civil action), he needs to follow prescribed rules. There are times when all that a person wants is an order of court where the rights of the parties are not going to be determined. There is no “action” being enforced or being tried. In many such instances, it is the discretion of the court being sought or a procedural issue sought to be endorsed. The court in such a case is not being asked to determine any rights of the parties. Now, the Civil Procedure Rules do not specifically provide for the procedure to be followed where there is no “action”. In such instances, I think it is permissible for such person to file a miscellaneous application because the court is not asked to determine any issues between the parties. This is common and permissible where all that the party wants is a mere order from the court which does not settle any rights or obligations of the parties. This for instance can cover applications for leave to institute suit out of time or for leave to commence judicial review proceedings.",
            "At this level, the court is not adjudicating on any rights. Where there is a call to adjudicate on rights of parties then it must be said that there is a “civil action” and this must be commenced in the manner prescribed by the Rules. A matter touching on whether or not a caution needs to be removed is in my view a civil action which then must be commenced in the manner prescribed by the Rules. The issue whether the caution should be removed or should remain is at that moment a contentious issue that must be tried on merits.",
            "The Land Registration Act,[15] does not prescribe any rules on how proceedings under the statute need to be commenced. In this event,   the default statute remains the Civil Procedure Act[16] which prescribes the manner in which civil suits must be instituted. Order 3 Rule 1 prescribes the way in which suits should be instituted. It specifically provides that “every suit shall be instituted by presenting a plaint to the court , or in such other manner as may be prescribed.” Thus the Civil Procedure Rules contemplate that suits shall be instituted by plaint or “other such manner” .",
            "One other such manner is Originating Summons under Order 37 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010. However Order 37 is not applicable to all suits but only to suits of a special nature which Order 37 specifies. Is the removal of a caution one of the specified matters ? I have carefully perused the provisions of Order 37 and I have not seen anywhere where cautions are mentioned. The precursor to the Land Registration Act[17] is the Registered Land Act (RLA).[18] Rule 8 of Order 37, which is yet to be amended to reflect the current law, provides that applications under the RLA other than under Sections 120, 128, 133, 138, 143, and 150 shall be made by originating summons. The removal of cautions under the RLA was contained in Section 133 of the statute. It will be noted that Section 133 is not one of the sections in which applications could be made by way of Originating Summons.[19]",
            "Section 71 of the Land Registration Act, which is the current law, is drafted in similar terms to Section 131 of the RLA (repealed).",
            "Section 107 of the Land Registration Act, which contains savings and transitional provisions, preserves certain rights which were exercisable immediately prior to the commencement of the said statute. It states as follows :-",
            " S. 107. (1) Unless the contrary is specifically provided for in this Act, any right, interest, title, power, or obligation acquired, accrued, established, coming into force or exercisable before the commencement of this Act shall continue to be governed by the law applicable to it immediately prior to the commencement of this Act.",
            "If it is apparent that the right to register a caution was exercisable before the commencement of the Land Registration Act (LRA). Such right unless the contrary is specifically provided continues to be exercisable and governed by the law that was applicable to it immediately prior to the commencement of the LRA. Since the LRA does not provide for a procedure that is contrary to the procedure provided under the RLA regime, the same procedure for the removal of cautions prevailing in the RLA regime, is the same procedure that will apply under the current law. The prior procedure did not provide for cautions to be removed by way of Miscellaneous Application or Originating Summons as we have seen above. In such instance the fall back is to commence suit by way of plaint as noted in the Civil Procedure Act.[20] It is therefore my considered view that an action for the removal of a caution needs to be commenced by way of Plaint in which suit the plaintiff needs to prove on a balance of probabilities why the defendant has no right to place the caution on his title and why the caution placed by the defendant needs to be removed.",
            "It is always advisable for a claimant to commence action by way of plaint unless there is a clear alternative provided by statute or the rules thereunder. Courts have had occasion to consider whether suits instituted by way of miscellaneous application are valid. Counsel for the respondent relied on the case of of Peter Mwema Kahoro & Another vs Benson Maina Githethuki,[21] In the said case the court (Azangalala J, as he the was) frowned upon a suit commenced by way of miscellaneous application. So too the court (Kasango J and Emukule J) in the case of Eutychus Muthui vs Apollo Nteere M’Abutu & 2 others[22] . In this case the applicant commenced a suit inter alia to compel the defendant to produce certain records relating to a land parcel. The suit was struck out as incompetent with the court relying upon the court of appeal decision in Board of Governors Nairobi School v Jackson Ireri Geta Nairobi[23] . A similar decision was made in the case of Kenya National Federation of Co-operatives vs Econet Wireless Kenya Limited & 3 Others[24].",
            "I am alive to the provisions of Article 159 (2) (d) of the Constitution[25] which provides that justice shall be administered without undue regard to technicalities. My view is that the commencement of suit in a manner in which the instituting documents cannot be held to be “pleadings”, goes beyond a mere technicality. It is different where the document filed can be assumed and be regarded as a particular pleading. This probably is the commencement of “suit by a letter” which Mr. Chebii alluded to in his submissions. If framed intelligibly such letter can be regarded as a plaint. However there has to exist special circumstances before such letter can be accepted to be a pleading. Such allowances ought not to be stretched so as to permit counsels to develop a habit of writing letters instead of filing plaints and argue that proceedings can be commenced in whichever way. The purpose of having rules of procedure is to have proceedings controlled in a logical sequence so that justice can be done to all parties. It is incumbent upon parties and counsels to follow the procedures laid out. This of course does not imply that a court has no discretion to permit some sort of deviation especially where the deviation is minimal and no prejudice is caused to the other party.",
            "If I am to allow the current “pleadings” to stand, I do not see how this matter will be determined without prejudice being caused to the defendant. Even if no prejudice will be caused to the defendant I would rather strike out this application at this stage, which will only invite minimal cost, rather than to allow the proceedings to stand, and thereafter be at a loss on how to thereafter proceed with the matter. The former action will benefit all parties and is certainly the lesser of the two evils.",
            "Given the reasons above, my view is that there is no suit before court capable of being determined on merits. I have little option but to strike out the miscellaneous application with costs. ",

            "RULING",
            "1. By Notice of Appeal dated 6th July, 2006 filed by Elgon View Resident’s Association and subsequently amended to include names of the Association’s officials as named in the title and Grounds of Appeal subsequently filed on 13th July, 2006, which the Appellants appealed against the 1st Respondent’s approval of the 2nd Respondent’s development of a light industry (a metal fabricating workshop) in Elgon View Estate in Eldoret on the grounds that: the approval was granted without consulting persons living in the neighbourhood; if allowed to construct the light industry, it would interfere with the residents’ quiet occupation of their residences and that it was likely to make a lot of noise and emit fumes; the area where the industry was supposed to be built is purely a high class residential area and if the 2nd Respondent’s development was approved, other industries were likely to come up; and  that the intended industry would be a nuisance to the residents.",
            "2. Upon Receipt of an Environmental Impact Assessment Project Report prepared by Dr. Grephas Opata on behalf of the 2nd Respondent, the 1st Respondent had communicated its approval of the 2nd Respondent’s workshop for church building ministry by letter dated 12th October, 2005 and subsequently issued an Environmental Impact Assessment Licence on 30th June 2006.",
            "3. The 1st Respondent objected to the Appeal on grounds that it was the responsibility of Eldoret Municipal Council to designate areas for development through its Planning Department; NEMA as a distinct body from Eldoret Municipal Council has no powers of control over the Council; if NEMA acted on the basis of omissions or actions of other bodies including Eldoret Municipal Council, it would be acting ultra vires and such action would be void ab initio; NEMA has the machinery provided for in the Environmental Management and Co-ordination Act (EMCA) to deal with the facility if and when it would emit fumes and noise and that it would be premature for NEMA to act before such events occur; and that the issue at hand was not noise or fumes but construction, which was not within the ambit of NEMA’s authority.",
            "4. The 2nd Respondent filed reply on August 21, 2006 stating that all the relevant parties living close to the 2nd Respondent’s development were consulted and gave their approval of the development; proper notice of the development was issued on all the necessary parties, including the Appellants but they failed to register their objections; the 1st Respondent’s approval was proper, factual and meritorious; there was no such persons as Elgon View Residents and the appeal should be dismissed on that basis; the 2nd Respondent had undertaken extensive development costing millions of shillings and the Appellant’s attempt to stop the development was belated and the 2nd Respondent would suffer irreparable damage if stopped; the Appellants had failed to show any damage they stood to suffer; and that the 2nd Respondent was not building any industry as alleged by the Appellants.",
            "5. In the appeal, parties were represented as follows: Mr. Kitiwa of Kitiwa & Company Advocates for the Appellants; Mr. Nyaberi, and subsequently Mr. Gitanda, both of Nyaberi & Company Advocates for the 1st Respondent; and Mr. Chemitei of Chemitei & Company Advocates for the 2nd Respondent. The appeal was heard, partly in Eldoret, on 10 occasions between 22nd August, 2006 and 8th June 2007.",
            "6. A total of 10 witnesses were called to testify. The Appellants called to testify: Nicholas Macharia Wambugu, a dentist who is the Secretary to the Appellant Association and a resident of Elgon View Estate; Rena Oyugi, a teacher and a member of the Appellant aAsociation whose house neighbours the 2nd Respondent’s facility;  John Mburu Karicho, a business man whose house is located about 300 yards from the 2nd Respondent’s facility; Timothy Kipkorir Busienei, the Chairman of the Appellant Association who is also a resident of Elgon View Estate; Eliud Kipchirchir Yego, a Land Surveyor and resident of the same Estate; and Stella Chemutai Keino, an environmental impact assessment expert and consultant hired by the Appellants to carry out “public consultation” on behalf of the Appellants and write a commentary on what was lacking on the 2nd Respondent’s environmental impact assessment Project Report submitted to the 1st Respondent. The 1st Respondent called two witnesses, namely: Nancy Muui the District Environment Officer for Uasin Gishu District and Veronica Kimutai, the 2nd Respondent’s Senior Standards Officer. The 2nd Respondent also called two witnesses, namely: James Muriuki Wamae, an Occupational Health Officer in charge of Uasin Gishu District and Soren Fyhn Kristen Pedersen, the Director of Mechai International, a missionary organization registered in Kenya in 1995.",
            "7. In the presence of representatives of all parties and some of their witnesses, the Tribunal visited the site in Eldoret on 22nd March, 2007 and observed that the 2nd Respondent was in the final stages of constructing a warehouse measuring approximately 100 x 50 metres on land parcel number 13/444 located off Nyerere Road in Eldoret, in an area generally known as Elgon View. It was observed that the facility has a basement floor windows fitted with double glass to filter noise and another floor at ground level. Ground floor was still under construction and statedly, the 2nd Respondent planned to construct its windows with three layers of glass and if necessary, add another layer with saw dust to act as sound buffer. Noise levels were tested while a metal cutter and subsequently, a grinder and a welding machine were in operation.",
            "8. In evidence, the Appellants faulted the 1st Respondent’s approval of the 2nd Respondent’s construction of a light industry in Elgon View in Eldoret on the basis that they, as residents of Elgon View, were not consulted before the development was approved by Eldoret Municipal Council, the Physical Planning Department that approved change of use of plot number 13/444 from residential to light industry and by the 1st Respondent, before approving the development; the area is zoned for residential purposes; residents of Elgon View were not consulted before the development was approved; the development had changed the beautiful appearance of an area that used to be a forest; the development was of a character not in keeping with developments in the area and if allowed to remain, would set a bad precedent and encourage industrial developments thereby altering the appearance of the area; the existence of a light industry would lower property values in the area; the facility was likely to generate noise and constitute nuisance to residents, thereby interfering with their enjoyment of their property; operations of the facility would create insecurity as its workers were likely to commit petty thefts from neighbouring houses; operations of the facility would increase traffic in a low density high class residential area; once in operation, the facility was likely to generate smoke which would interfere with residents; that the facility ought to have been located in an industrial area in Eldoret; and witnesses were suspicious that the 2nd Respondent may be planning to carry out industrial activities of a larger scale than what had been presented, feared that bigger and additional machines may be introduced at some point in time and expressed doubt about who would check on the operations. On these bases, the Appellants urged the Tribunal to revoke the 1st Respondent’s approval of the development and order that the development be relocated.",
            "9. Witnesses for the Appellants admitted that they knew of the 2nd Respondent’s proposed development before construction work began, but they did not make concerted efforts to deliberate with the 2nd Respondent’s representative, who is also a resident of Elgon View and a member of the Association. Neither did they raise objections with the 1st Respondent before work commenced. The 1st witness, Nicholas Macharia Wambugu stated that he saw the development coming up, even before the walls were put up. He had also seen a notice of change of user on a notice board erected on the proposed site but did not personally raise any objection. In cross-examination, he stated that having been to the site on the day of the Tribunal’s visit, he would not say that what the developer would be doing there would affect him and had no fear that the facility would emit fumes. It also seemed to him that the 2nd Respondent had complied with all the development requirements. He only had fear that other industries would be located in the area in future if the 2nd Respondent’s development is allowed.",
            "10. The second witness, Rena Oyugi stated that she got to know Mechai International was intending to construct a facility in Elgon View before construction work began but did not object to it. Instead, she started considering the matter with her neighbours. She admitted that the noise she heard when noise levels were tested during the Tribunal’s visit “ was not much” and she would not hear it from her house. About fumes, she asked, “which fumes? May be there will be fumes when they start operating”, expressing doubt that there would be fumes at all. Her main concern was security “in the sense of small time theft by people who work in the factory.” She stated that such people could steal a bicycle in her garden. The third witness, Timothy Kipkorir Busienei, had been aware of the 2nd Respondent’s development and had seen it since the year 2003. He had seen an advertisement of the proposed development in Kenya Times Newspaper but had not asked the developer to allow him to go into the facility to see what was going on. Having been at the site during the Tribunal’s visit, he stated that he did not and would not have a problem with noise from the 2nd Respondent’s grinder. He appreciated what the 2nd Respondent is doing but his main concern was that the facility was not in the right place. He was suspicious that the machines he saw during the site visit may not be the ones the 2nd Respondent will eventually use. He had objected to change of user to both Eldoret Municipal Council and the District Physical Liaison Officer but the officers went ahead and approved the 2nd Respondent’s development. He explicitly recognized that engineers in the Council’s Planning Department are the ones responsible for what takes place in a particular area.",
            "11. The fourth witness, Eliud Kipchirchir Yego, a land surveyor, had known of the 2nd Respondent’s development since inception. He saw a poster on a tree on site advertising change of use before any construction work began but he did not have time to read it.  He later expressed concern that the development was likely to cause environmental pollution and set a bad precedent but stated that he had nothing to show that ElgonView is zoned for residential purposes only and should have no light industries. He further recognized that “it is the Municipal Council which does town planning. It is the Council that gives change of user approval. It is true the Council should be the one organizing the town.” He also stated that he is aware that the 1st Respondent carries out annual audits of on-going projects. Stella Keino was instructed to comment on the Project report submitted to the 1st Respondent on behalf of the 2nd Respondent and she wrote, stating that she did not find in the Project Report a description of the applicable regulatory framework, zoning laws, technology procedures and information on public participation, among others, but she did not visit the facility to find out what was going on there. Instead, she only walked around it before writing her comments.",
            "12. The 1st Respondent’s evidence was that the development proponent’s representative, Mr. Soren Fyhn Pedersen consulted with the District Environment Officer  (DEO) for Uasin Gishu District before commencing the development in question and was advised to prepare an environmental impact assessment project report, which he did. The report was submitted to the 1st Respondent, which subsequently forwarded it to the DEO, whereupon, the DEO constituted a task group comprising experts in relevant areas to look into the matter concerning the proposed development. The task group visited the site where the proponent was, at the time, operating a workshop in West Indies area in Eldoret as well as the proposed site in Elgon View in the same town, considered the proponent’s Project Report, site and building plans which had been approved by Eldoret Municipal Council and Uasin Gishu Physical Planning Liaison Planning Committee and subsequently wrote a report to the 1st Respondent, indicating that they were satisfied with the proposed mitigation measures.",
            "13. After consideration of the task force’s report, the project report submitted by the proponent, a letter of objection to the development received by the 1st Respondent from some of Elgon View residents, a statement of no objection to the development from a Dr. Jakaiti, one of the proponent’s immediate neighbour, a letter dated 4th September 2003 from the District Physical Planning Officer, Uasin Gishu District conveying approval of change of user of plot 13/444 in Eldoret from residential to workshop and Eldoret Municipal Council’s letter dated 25th November, 2003 conveying the Council’s approval on 10th November 2003 of the proposed development, the 1st Respondent issued to the 2nd Respondent a letter dated 12th October 2005 conveying its approval of the development, subject to conditions which the developer had to accept or reject. Upon acceptance of the condition’s conveyed to the 1st respondent by the proponent’s letter of 21st February 2006, the 1st Respondent issued to the 2nd Respondent an environmental impact assessment licence on 30th June, 2006.",
            "14. Regarding noise, which the Appellants complained about, the 1st Respondent’s evidence was that the proposed activities could generate noise. However, the proposed mitigation measures, including the planned use of sound-proofing materials and construction of a stone wall all around the 2nd Respondent’s facility, were adequate to safeguard against noise. The 1st Respondent was satisfied that if the project was implemented according to proposed mitigation measures, it could co-exist with residential developments in the area and would pose no problem. In any case, once the project was approved, the 1st Respondent’s DEO was required to monitor compliance. The 1st Respondent clarified that objections to development do not necessarily lead it to deny development permission.",
            "15. Regarding the location of the proposed development, witnesses for the 1st Respondent testified that although the area where the 2nd Respondent proposed to construct a workshop, and not an industry was a low density residential area, Eldoret Municipal Council has had a problem with zoning, is still in the process of zoning the municipality, there is no industrial area and industries are scattered all over the area of the municipality. They stated that within Elgon View, a project similar to the 2nd Respondent’s has been and is being operated by the Catholic Church. They maintained that the 2nd Respondent had complied with all the legal requirements and the development should be allowed to proceed.",
            "16. Witnesses for the 2nd Respondent testified that it is a charitable organization that helps to establish churches, schools and orphanages by assisting in constructing roofs and pillars to allow early use of facilities. It was incorporated in Kenya in 1995 and since then, Mr. Soren Kristen Petersen, an Electrical and Construction Engineer, has been its director.",
            "17. Before re-locating to Elgon View, the 2nd Respondent was operating a workshop on land belonging to someone else in an area known as West Indies within Eldoret Municipality in compliance with health, noise and safety requirements and there was no report of any problem arising from its operations there.",
            "18. Desirous of owning premises for its operations, the 2nd Respondent’s director looked for land all over Eldoret and finally found Plot Numbers 13/442; 13/443 and 13/444 in Elgon View area which it purchased, knowing that the land was residential. Subsequently, the 2nd Respondent obtained change of user from the Physical Planning Department in respect of land parcel Number 13/444 on 9TH October 2006, approval of site and building plans from Eldoret Municipal Council, development approval and EIA licence from the 1st Respondent and commenced construction work on 1st March 2004. The approvals and EIA licence were submitted to the Tribunal in evidence.",
            "19. After work commenced, the Occupational Health and Safety Officer in charge of Uasin Gishu District also perused the 2nd Respondent’s building plans, visited the site and confirmed that the 2nd Respondent was in compliance with health, safety and noise requirements and had taken noise reduction measures. It was explained that the Occupational Safety and Health Department in Uasin Gishu has a scientific way of measuring noise levels in decibels using a noise meter and could apply the measure to the 2nd Respondent’s facility to ensure that the 90 decibels limit is not exceeded. The Department’s officer who visited the 2nd Respondent’s facility expressed satisfaction that the level of noise that the workshop was likely to generate was likely to be far below the limit and that if the workshop is operated as proposed and proposed mitigation measures implemented, it will pose no problem. The Occupational Health Officer monitors the workshop once every month and will require the developer to carry out safety and health audits every year.",
            "20. It was the 2nd Respondent’s evidence that during the change of use approval process, its director made efforts to consult with neighbours and obtained development approval from Mr. Neil Lorrens, a Reverent Joseph, Mary Kamau and Charles Jakaiti who were the immediate neighbours to the property in question. The director also published a change of user notice on a notice board which he erected on a fence at the proposed site and then invited Eldoret Municipal Council Engineer to inspect and approve it, which the Engineer did and confirmed that the notice was satisfactory. The director also issued a public notice of the proposed change of user in both Taifa Leo and Kenya Times newspapers but none of the Elgon View Resident’s Association members made efforts to inquire about the proposed development, what it would be doing and how it might affect the environment, if at all. Efforts made by the 2nd Respondent’s director to explain the proposed development, even through the councillor for the area, who is also Eldoret Municipality’s Mayor, failed because the residents were not receptive of the director. Instead, members of the Appellant Association sued the 2nd Respondent in Eldoret CMCC No. 793 A of 2004, seeking an injunction to stop the development, but the suit was dismissed.",
            "21. It was explained that the 2nd Respondent will utilize the basement of the two-floor workshop for cutting metal using two metal cutters and for storage of materials. To reduce noise that may be generated in the process, all the widows of the basement floor have been fitted with double glass which are expected to filter up to 98 per cent of noise. The ground floor, which is still under construction, is intended to be used for welding and joining of cut materials, for storage of materials and to display items for donors. To safeguard against noise from ground floor, the 2nd Respondent plans to construct windows with three layers of glass. If necessary, saw dust could be used to add another layer to act as noise buffer. A silencer could also be installed, should that be necessary. In addition, the facility has empty space all around it and the proponent plans to plant wattle trees in the space behind it to act as a noise buffer in addition to a stone wall that has already been built all round. The 2nd Respondent’s director stated that the sound proofing measures were approved by an expert. The only smoke expected to be generated in the course of operations would be from welding and is expected to be minimal. If heavy machines are to be introduced, the 2nd Respondent will seek all necessary approvals.",
            "22. Regarding traffic, it was explained that the roofing materials to be prepared in the facility would be light enough to be transported by 3-4-ton trucks that are readily available in Eldoret. It was indicated that the 2nd Respondent maintains a record of all workers in Elgon View; has tested and intends to test all potential employees on skills and character in addition to contacting referees to ensure that only skilled and honest people work in the facility to guard against theft. So far, the 2nd Respondent’s workers have not stolen anything from it.",
            "23. Witnesses for the 2nd Respondent maintained that Elgon View is not a purely residential area because there are schools, a Catholic workshop similar to the one the 2nd Respondent is constructing and the 2nd Respondent’s immediate neighbors is constructing apartments. The 2nd Respondent’s director maintained that he is also a resident of Elgon View who lives on one of the three plots he purchased, in very close proximity to the facility in question, receives visitors on a regular basis and is concerned about the safety and comfort of his visitors. If asked to re-locate from Elgon View, it would suffer total loss of the 6-7 million shillings that has already been spent on the project because the structure already built cannot be moved. On these bases, the 2nd Respondent asked the Tribunal to allow the project to proceed to completion.",
            "24. The Tribunal has carefully considered the evidence tendered, the situation on the ground observed during its site visit and the applicable law.  The Tribunal finds as follows on the pertinent issues arising:",
            "25. The purpose of an EIA licensing process prescribed by Part VI of the Environmental Management and Co-ordination Act (EMCA) of 1999 and the regulations made thereunder (Legal Notice 101 of 2003) is to assess the likely significant impacts of a proposed development project on the environment. In deciding on the nature of likely impacts, account must be taken of the status of the environment within which the proposed project will be undertaken, as well as the negative impacts that the proposed project are likely to have on the environment. In that regard, existing air quality, water quality, traffic, noise, aesthetic and other features of the environment in the area in which the development is proposed to be carried out, as well as the likely impacts of the project on the environmental media are relevant considerations.",
            "26. The status of the environment is not determined by the fact alone that an area is designated as a residential area, a high class residential area or even as an area of low population density. The Tribunal is not sitting on appeal from a decision of the Physical planning authority in Uasin Gishu, or Eldoret Municipal Council. Therefore, if a designation of Elgon View exists, that designation can only be indicative of the nature of environmental considerations that might arise. What is critical is to ascertain the actual status of the environment in the locality and the likely impacts of the development in question on the environment.",
            "27. The evidence that was adduced and observations made during the Tribunal’s visit of the site showed that the quality of air, the level of traffic, noise, aesthetics and other features of the environment in the locality are consistent with environmental requirements for areas used for human habitation. The evidence adduced, observations made during the site visit and demonstration of the operation of machines to ascertain noise levels conducted during the visit show that the operations of the development in question will not exceed noise, traffic, air quality, water quality and aesthetic aspects of an area used for human habitation. There was no evidence to show that the 2nd Respondent’s development would adversely impact on the environment in Elgon View in ways that could not be mitigated by the measures that have been proposed by the 2nd Respondent in the Environmental Impact Assessment Project report. There was no indication, for example, that the operations of the workshop will constitute noise pollution in the area. In fact, Appellant’s witnesses did agree, after demonstrations that the noise levels were low and would not affect them. The demonstration proved that the sound-proofing measures which had been adopted are effective. What appears to be of more concern to the residents is their suspicion that the developer might scale up workshop operations to higher levels, thereby constituting noise pollution, traffic problems and other environmental challenges. In that event, as rightly pointed out by witnesses for the 1st Respondent and the Occupational Health and safety Officer in charge of Uasin Gishu, mechanisms do exist in both the 1st Respondent and the Labour Department in Uasin Gishu, among others, to deal with any adverse consequences that might arise from the 2nd Respondent’s operations.",
            "28. The Appellants raised other issues, in particular, that opportunity for public participation had been denied by the 2nd Respondent. However, evidence showed that there was consultation between the 2nd Respondent’s director and potentially affected neighbours, including the Appellants herein. It is unlikely that a full EIA study would have materially changed the situation. Other technical irregularities pointed out by the Appellants, for example, that the 2nd Respondent did not fully comply with the procedure for obtaining change of user approval, were also not proven by the Appellants, to the satisfaction of the Tribunal. In fact, witnesses for the Appellants acknowledged having seen a notice of change of user erected on site and public notices in Taifa Leo and Kenya Times News papers. The Tribunal does not consider these matters as vitiating the decision taken by the 1st Respondent on the central issue, that is, the development of a workshop for preparing trusses and other building materials for churches, schools and orphanages in Elgon View area in Eldoret is not likely to introduce significant adverse environmental impacts which cannot be mitigated through appropriate measures such as those proposed in the EIA Project report. In deed, the 2nd Respondent has gone out of its way to plant over 2000 trees in the area in collaboration with Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, is planning to plant trees in the space behind his facility and in front of the facility to screen it from the view of people passing on the road which would mitigate the aesthetic impact which the Appellant  complained about, has installed noise buffers on windows on the ground floor of the facility in question, has kept the whole of its compound and a section of the nearby Rive Soi where the director is resident, in a very clean state.",
            "29. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the appeal fails and directs that:-",
            "1.The 1st Respondent’s approval of the development and the EIA licence subsequently issued on 30th June 2006 are affirmed.",

            "\t1.    This matter commenced as Civil Suit Number 738 of 2003, filed in the High Court of Kenya at Nairobi. On 30th May 2006, by the consent of the parties, Lady Justice Joyce Aluoch ordered that the suit be transferred to the National Environmental Tribunal for final disposal. Accordingly, on 5th June 2006, the file was sent to this Tribunal.",
            "\t2.    Following a preliminary review of the file, the Tribunal made a copy of the file available to National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) to enable it consider whether the issues raised in the dispute were of such a nature as to merit a referral of the matter to the Tribunal for direction under section 132 of the Environmental Management and Coordination Act, 1999 (EMCA). By letter dated 13th July 2006, NEMA communicated its desire that the matter be dealt with by the Tribunal as a referral, which constitutes the first such referral.",
            "\t3.    Referrals to the Tribunal are provided for under section 132 of EMCA. This states that “when any matter to be determined by the Authority under this Act appears to it to involve a point of law or to be of unusual importance or complexity it may, after giving notice to the concerned parties, refer the matter to the Tribunal for direction.”",
            "\t4.    The powers of the Tribunal on a referral are dealt with under section 126(2). This states that “the Tribunal shall, upon an appeal …or a referral made to it by the Authority on any matter relating to this Act, inquire into the matter and make an award, give directions, make orders or make decisions thereon …” Accordingly once seized of a matter, upon a referral or otherwise, the powers of the Tribunal include the power to make a final determination of the issues in dispute between the parties, subject, of course, to the right of the parties to appeal to the High Court under section 130 of EMCA.",

The defence averred, additionally, that, in light of the provisions of EMCA, the High Court lacked jurisdiction to determine this dispute, which is vested only in the National Environmental Tribunal. The defence incorporated a counterclaim, but as this counterclaim was not pursued before this Tribunal, we say no more about it. On 3rd February 2005, Hon Justice Ransley ruled that EMCA did not take away the High Court's jurisdiction and, as already stated, the matter then came to this Tribunal for determination through a consent order.",

            "\t8.    The evidence showed that the parties in this dispute own adjoining properties. On their property, the Plaintiffs constructed a block of 33 flats for residential use in 1989. Sometime between 1989 and 1990, following the construction of a factory on their plot of land, the Defendants started manufacturing footwear. In 1997, they started manufacturing confectionary in the same premises, but, in 2004, the confectionary plant was relocated to a newly constructed factory on a different site while the factory on the site adjoining the Plaintiffs’ plot continued to manufacture footwear.",
            "\t9.    The Plaintiffs alleged in their amended Plaint that the Defendants have constantly caused offensive and pestilential gases, smells and vapours to come into and be on the Plaintiffs' premises causing a nuisance, which they particularized as follows:",

The Plaintiffs particularized their loss as follows:",
            "\ta.   Cost of repairs done to the building, which comprised the replacement of the galvanized iron sheet roof - Kshs 354,000.00; and",
            "\tb.   Lost rent arising from inability to rent out the ground floor rooms as a result of the contamination by effluent - Kshs 571,200.00, all together, a total of Kshs. 925,200.00.",
            "\t12.   The Defendants denied causing the discharge of offensive and pestilential gases, smells and vapours; causing a nuisance; causing the discharge of offensive and harmful waste; causing flooding of, or damage to, the Plaintiffs premises; or being negligent. The Defendants averred that it had in place a reasonable, proper and safe infrastructure for purposes of ensuring a safe and environmentally friendly waste disposal system. Thus, the issues were joined.",
            "\t13.   The Defendants argued additionally, that the location of their factory premises was specifically designated for light industrial use and not for residential use and that the City Council of Nairobi had granted planning permission for the construction of the factory. In constructing a block of flats for residential use in this locality, the principle of volenti non fit injuria, applied and the Plaintiffs could not be heard to complain.",
            "\t14.   In evidence Mr Gitiriku Wainaina testified that contaminated effluent in different colours seep through the factory walls into his compound and that this has made the ground floor rooms damp and uninhabitable. Further the gaseous emissions from the factory's chimney has corroded the iron sheets on the roof of his flats forcing him to replace the iron sheets three times in the years 1999, 2001 and 2003. He testified that tenants in 15 units of the flats have left the premises, 11 of them due to corrosion of the iron sheets and four from the ground floor flats, which were damp.",
            "\t15.   During his testimony, Mr Wainaina also asked that the Tribunal order the Defendants to buy him out. The value of the flats was put at Kshs 5.3 million according to a 1st July 2003 valuation report produced in evidence by Mr Christopher Mbindah, a registered land economist and land valuer, who had been asked by the Plaintiffs to carry out an open market valuation of the property.",
            "\t16.   Mr Wainaina produced in evidence cash sale receipts for the expenses of replacing the corrugated iron sheet roof totaling Kshs. 354,000.00 the details of which were as follows:",

            "\t17.   The Plaintiffs’ second witness was Dr Fredrick Otieno Oduor, a chemist working at the Chemical and Industrial Consultant Unit of the Department of Chemistry of the University of Nairobi. He testified that he had been commissioned by the firm of Ng'ang'a Thiong'o & Company Advocates to carry out an analysis of emissions and effluent from Kenafric Industries, the Respondent herein. Dr Oduor produced a written report dated 6th December 2006 which was put in evidence.",
            "\t18.   Dr Odour testified that on visiting the site on 8th December 2006, he found no evidence of emissions from the chimneys, nor any effluent to be sampled for chemical analysis and interpretation. He therefore decided to take pictures of the destruction that could have been caused by the alleged emissions from the factory. He produced in evidence pictures showing corroded rail gutter on the roof, corroded galvanized iron sheets, and corroded wall painting on the stairway.",
            "\t19.   Dr Oduor's conclusion was that the damage seen in sections of the buildings, as evidenced by the pictures, could have been due to corrosive emissions from the factory. He opined that these could have been sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and even carbon dioxide. In cross-examination Dr Oduor admitted that he could not tell the source of the emissions causing the corrosion but he was emphatic that its cause was the gases he had enumerated - sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and even carbon dioxide- : “I know the chemistry of corrosion,” he maintained.",
            "\t20.   The Plaintiffs also called to give evidence Mr Owate Norman Wambayi, a Consultant on health, safety and environment and the Chairman of MICAS Limited the firm that had been commissioned in 2003 to assess the effects of pollution from the Defendants' factory on the Plaintiffs property. MICAS had produced a report dated 20th August 2003, which was produced in evidence.",
            "\t21.   Mr Wambayi sampled sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide arising from the operations at the factory belonging to the Defendants. He collected the samples from three sites directly in the path of gaseous emissions from the factory but from outside the factory as he was denied access to the factory premises. He carried out the analysis of the samples at the Institute of Nuclear Science, University of Nairobi laboratory. The results showed that the concentration levels of sulphur dioxide sampled were between 20 and 23 µg/m3 as compared to World Health Organization (WHO) standards of 60 µg/m3. The concentration of hydrogen sulphide was with respect to one sample spot 5 ppm and with respect to the other two 6 ppm. He stated that a concentration of over 8 ppm represents the odour threshold, while a concentration of over 10 ppm is toxic for 8 hours.",
            "\t22.   Mr. Wambayi concluded that the levels of sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide do not pose a potential human health hazard but represent a public nuisance. He opined that the damage to the galvanized iron sheet roofing could be due to corrosion by the gases. In evidence he maintained that it was not likely that the corrosion damage could have originated from another factory elsewhere, but conceded under cross-examination that the area, being an industrial area, and one exposed to mobile sources of sulphur dioxide from vehicular traffic, generally exhibited high levels of sulphur dioxide with a baseline level of about 5 µg/m3.",
            "\t23.   The Respondent's first witness was Mr Tom Owino Oduor, the Chief Executive of the ECM Centre, the firm which, in 2003, had been commissioned to carry out an environmental audit of the factory by the Defendants herein pursuant to the requirements of the EMCA and the Regulations made under it. The ECM Centre is registered as an EIA Expert with NEMA under registration number 109, while Mr Oduor is registered with NEMA as an individual expert under registration number 0228. Mr Oduor had not, however, personally carried out the audit study in this case. This had been done by Dr Kariuki, also of the ECM Centre, who was not available to give evidence.",
            "\t24.   Mr. Oduor produced in evidence the Environmental Audit Report dated November 2004. The Plaintiffs argued that the Tribunal should not accept Mr. Oduor’s evidence since he is not the one who carried out the audit. In the view of the Tribunal, since it is the ECM Centre that had been commissioned to carry out the audit, any authorized employee of the Centre can produce the audit report.",
            "\t25.   The Report identified the wastes generated from the industrial processes at the factory to be sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide, which it said, are “sucked out of the factory through vents and emitted into the air through chimney stacks (see p.17).” The report goes on to state at paragraph 3.4.2 that “the study tested the levels of sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide and concludes that the emissions are negligible and within U.S.A. EPA and WHO limits.”",
            "\t26.   To the Environmental Audit report was annexed (Annex 2) a pollution study of Kenafric Industries Limited by The ECM Centre carried out in August 2003. This Report states that samples of sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide were collected on 29th and 30th July 2003. Three of these samples were taken from the rooftop, two from the stacks and another two at the ground level on days on which both the confectionary and the rubber factories (for footwear) were operating normally. The wind direction was towards the factory when sampling was done. The Report noted that Central Glass Works is located in the vicinity while Kenya Breweries lies across the valley. There is also the busy Thika Road and some unofficial dumpsites around.",
            "\t27.   The result of the sulphur dioxide samples ranged from 30 to 60 µg/m3 as compared to the WHO maximum allowable limit of 125 µg/m3 for Europe and an EPA maximum allowable limit of 140 µg/m3. The Report also stated that based on wind directions, one can surmise that there are significant external sources of the gas outside the factory, among them other industries and vehicular traffic. For hydrogen sulphide the results of the samples ranged from 2.01 ppm to 14. 10 ppm as compared to the EPA objectionable odour threshold of 10 ppm and a WHO allowable level of 10 ppm.  These standards are only for human health. The report notes that organic dumpsites are a major source of hydrogen sulphide.",
            "\t28.   The Defendants' 2nd witness was Mr Seeruirasan Gururayan, an electrical engineer by training who works as the project manager of the factory. He testified that the factory uses three boilers and has two chimneys of a height of about 22 metres that lead gases out of the factory, and that no gases are directed at the Plaintiffs’ building. He pointed out that the roof of the factory itself is not corroded. He attributed the corrosion of the Plaintiffs' galvanized iron sheet roof to the quality of iron sheets used. Regarding effluent he stated that the factory drains this through a pipe, and not into the building belonging to the Plaintiffs, which is 2.5 metres away and is separated from the factory only by a perimeter wall.",
            "\t29.   NEMA's first witness was Mr Justus Kathenge, an Assistant Director in the Department of Forward Planning at the City Council of Nairobi. He testified that the approval for the construction of the residential flats was granted only on 10th September 2001 whereas the planning permission for the construction of a light industry on the Defendants' premises was granted 16th February 1996. The two developments fell within Zone 16, which is zoned for residential and light industrial use.",
            "\t30.   Samuel Munene, NEMA's second witness is a pollution control officer working with NEMA. Along with Mr Dickson Njora, a gazetted NEMA environmental inspector, he visited the site of the factory on 12th July 2006 and prepared an Inspection Report. The Report stated that no liquid effluents, apart from storm water, were being produced.",
            "\t31.   Gaseous emissions were however being generated and released into the environment through chimney stacks. The roof of the factory was not corroded but part of the roof where the boiler was housed was corroded and had gaping holes. The cause of this corrosion could not be ascertained since the boiler had been removed (during the transfer of the confectionary factory to another site). Roofs in the area were found to be generally rusted. It went on: “a three story flat belonging to Mr. Gitiriku had rusted roof except for one wing ... we learnt that this section of the house had been re-roofed two years ago after the iron sheets got corroded and started leaking.”",
            "\t32.   The NEMA Inspection Report concluded as follows:  “In this area there are two incompatible land uses next to each other … It is difficult to attribute the roof rusting in the area from emissions from the industry without further investigations … whether the present emissions had caused the rusting and corrosion of the iron roofs in the area can only be determined through an independent analysis.”",
            "\t33.   Parties agreed to an expert to prepare an independent report. Subsequently, they obtained quotations for the conduct of an analysis, but they could not agree on how to meet the costs. Due to this, that is where the evidence rested, apart from the observations of the Tribunal members during the site visit, which largely reflected the evidence already availed to it.",
            "\t34.   In submissions Mr. Thiongo framed the issue for determination to be “whether the Defendants' factory operations caused offensive gases, smells and vapours to be emitted into the Plaintiffs' property and was the cause of the damage to the roof and walls.” He submitted that on the basis of the evidence adduced, the Plaintiffs had established their case on a balance of probability and prayed for judgement against the Defendants as prayed in the Plaint.",
            "\t35.   Mr Arwa similarly identified the issue for determination to be whether the Plaintiffs had proved on credible evidence the allegations made against the Defendants. He submitted that the claim related essentially to a compensation for damage arising from alleged past pollution before the relocation of the confectionary. He submitted that the evidence showed that the pollution levels were within allowable limits and that there was nothing to link the alleged corrosion on the claimants premises to the activities taking place in the factory: virtually all roofs in the area are corroded due to the presence of several industries and further the quality of the iron sheets on the Plaintiffs' roof had not been confirmed. Mr. Arwa further argued that the Plaintiffs had been unable to prove, in financial terms, the loss they sustained by reason of the corrosion of their roof.",
            "\t36.   In parting Mr. Arwa submitted that as the Plaintiffs were seeking compensation for alleged past pollution, rather than ongoing pollution, the orders they are seeking “are not related to environmental conservation but are in the nature of ordinary civil remedies which should be the preserve of the ordinary civil courts rather than the Tribunal ... the environment will not be better managed or conserved by the granting of the compensation order sought and it is for these reasons that we urge this Tribunal to dismiss this suit with costs.”",
            "\t37.   It suffices to dispose of Mr Arwa's last point that having come to this Tribunal through a consent order, it is not open to the parties to argue that the Tribunal is not the appropriate forum for the determination of the issues in dispute. But we might add also that, in our respectful view, a resolution of a dispute arising from past pollution can contribute significantly to enhancing present environmental conservation, not least because the Tribunal can, in appropriate cases, make an order for environmental restoration under section108 of EMCA.",
            "\t38.   NEMA (Grace Kimani) posed the issue for determination by the Tribunal in the following words: “Taking into account that there are other industries in the area, was the corrosion of the iron sheets on the roof of the Plaintiffs' flats as result of the gaseous emissions from the Defendants' factory?” The Tribunal considers this to be the central issue for determination in this dispute. Given the nature and state of the evidence adduced before it, the Tribunal is satisfied that the questions raised are sufficiently complex to justify the referral to it of this issue for determination and directions under section 132 of EMCA.",
            "\t39.   From the evidence adduced before the Tribunal, the following conclusions are drawn:",
            "\ta.   There are enhanced levels of sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide in the atmosphere of this industrialized area, in which there are not only several factories, but also heavy vehicular traffic and unofficial dumpsites, all of which emit these particular gases;",
            "\tb.   The Defendants' industrial activities, particularly in the period between 1997 and 2004, when the Defendants manufactured confectionaries at this site, have contributed to the enhanced atmospheric levels of sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide in the area;",
            "\tc.   The corrosion of the galvanized iron sheets used for roofing on the Plaintiffs' block of flats was caused by the gaseous emissions, more particularly sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide;",
            "\td.   The severity of the corrosion of the galvanized iron sheets used for roofing on the Plaintiffs' block of flats which necessitated the frequent repairs was partly the result of the quality of iron sheets the Plaintiffs used; and",
            "\te.   On the evidence adduced, it is not possible to determine with precision the respective contributions to the corrosion of the iron sheets that arose from the industrial activities of the Defendants as opposed to that which arose from the enhanced levels of corroding gases in the general atmosphere in the locality.",
            "\t40.   The question that arises for the determination of the Tribunal is whether, given that the state of the evidence adduced in this case, the Defendants can be held liable for the damage to the roof of the Plaintiffs' block of flats and for the loss thereby suffered by the Plaintiffs.",
            "\t41.   In a suit for negligence and nuisance, such as this one, the claimant on whom the burden of proving the damage lies discharges the burden if he shows that, on a balance of probabilities, the act in question caused or materially contributed to the injury or damage. It is enough to show that the defendant materially increased the risk of harm from a known source. The case against the defendant is proved where a prima facie case has been made out against him on a balance of probabilities and he (the defendant) has not adduced evidence of his innocence. (Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edition, vol. 45(2) at para. 317).",
            "\t42.   Once a prima facie case has been made out, for the defendant to exculpate himself, he would need to adduce evidence to the contrary. Such evidence must be of sufficient cogence to demonstrate that the damage in question arose from a cause other than the defendant's act. It is not enough merely to point to the possibility that the damage arose also from the act of some other unspecified person.",
            "\t43.  As it is not necessary that the defendant be the only cause of the damage in question, the exculpatory evidence must go beyond merely showing that some other unspecified person also contributed to the damage. If some other such person did contribute, that person needs to be identified with sufficient particularity to enable the person concerned to be joined as a third party in the proceedings so that liability can be apportioned. If that is not done, the person sued shall bear the entire burden of compensating the injured party.",
            "\t44.   The Tribunal believes the applicable law in circumstances such as the present one to be as stated in Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edition, vol. 45(2) para 347): if each of several persons, not acting in concert, commits a tort against another person substantially contemporaneously and causing the same or indivisible damage, each several tortfeasor is liable for the whole damage.”",
            "\t45.   Applying this principle of law to the present case, the Plaintiffs did demonstrate that, on a balance of probabilities, the Defendants' activities during the period in question contributed materially to the enhanced levels of corrosive gaseous emissions in this area that caused the corrosion of the galvanized iron sheets on the roof of the Plaintiffs' block of flats. The Defendants pointed to other sources of similar gaseous emissions, which together with their (i.e. the Defendants' activities) contributed to the enhanced levels of corrosive gases in the atmosphere in this locality.",
            "\t46.   But the Defendants stopped short of identifying any particular source or sources with sufficient particularity to displace the presumption that the Defendants, by mere dint of physical proximity to the Plaintiffs' premises, made a material contribution to enhanced level of the corrosive gaseous emissions about which the Plaintiffs are complaining. In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the Defendants are liable for the damage to the galvanized iron sheets used by the Plaintiffs on their block of flats.",
            "\t47.   In the Tribunal's respectful view, the Defendants' defence that the quality of the iron sheets used by the Plaintiffs was poor and that, because of this, the iron sheets used as roofing for their block of flats suffered corrosion while some other iron sheets used for roofing in the area, such as the iron sheets on the roof of the Defendants factory itself, did not suffer comparable corrosion, can be disposed of fairly briefly. It is no defence to a claim based on tortuous damage to property that the Plaintiffs' property would not have suffered such damage had the property in question been of higher quality.",
            "\t48.   The Plaintiffs claim for special damages was for an amount of Kshs 925,200.00. Of this Kshs 354,000.00 was for damage the replacement of the galvanized iron sheet on the roof. The balance was for lost rent. The Plaintiffs adduced no evidence to support the evidence of Mr Wainaina regarding the lost rent. Unsupported, Mr Wainaina's evidence on this point is not sufficient to support an award of compensation.",
            "\t49.   The Plaintiffs also did not adduce sufficient evidence to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the Defendants' activities were a material cause of the dampness of the lower ground floor of the Plaintiffs' block of flats. The evidence adduced by the Defendants that they had a proper system for the drainage of the effluent from their premises was corroborated by the evidence of the officers from NEMA who visited the site. The Tribunal therefore declines to award any compensation for this claim as well.",
            "\t50.   The defendants had argued in their defence that in any case, the plaintiffs could not complain of the damage suffered on the basis of the principle of volenti non fit injuria. The evidence adduced showed that this area is zoned for mixed residential and light industrial use. Therefore, the principle of volenti non fit injuria does not apply. ",
            "\t51.   In evidence the Plaintiffs asked the Tribunal to order that the Defendants purchase their property. However this prayer did not form part of the prayers in the Plaint or Amended Plaint. If the Appellant had wished to pursue this prayer the proper procedure would have been to apply to the Tribunal for leave to amend the amended Plaint further. This was not done, and therefore the Tribunal has no basis for making any order on this issue.",
            "\t52.   The Tribunal therefore unanimously decides as follows and makes the following order:",
            "\tThe Defendants are liable for the damage suffered by the Plaintiffs as a result of the corrosion to the galvanized iron sheets used for roofing the Plaintiffs' block of flats and are ordered to compensate the Plaintiffs by paying Kshs 354,000.00 which shall attract interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of the filing of the Plaint in the High Court until payment in full.",
            "\t53.   The parties asked the Tribunal for costs. Under rule 39 of the Tribunal Rules the Tribunal cannot award costs without hearing the parties on the issue of costs. The Tribunal therefore invites parties to address it on costs on a date to be agreed.",

            "\t1.    By Notice of Appeal dated 29 June 2006 filed in the National Environment Tribunal on 30 June 2006, the Appellants namely, We Care About Nairobi Do It (hereinafter, the 1st Appellant) and Kyuna and Shanzu Road Residents Association (hereinafter, the 2nd Appellant, together referred to as the Appellants) entered an Appeal against the Director General, NEMA (hereinafter, the 1st Respondent) and the proponent of the project, House and Plots Limited (hereafter, the 2nd Respondent), challenging NEMA's initial approval of EIA report for the proposed construction of twenty three houses on  LR 7158/53 subsequently LR7158/385-388  without approved architectural and structural plans and amalgamation of plots, LR number 7157/385, 386, 387 and 388 without approvals. The Appellants requested the Tribunal to order demolition of the illegal structures.",
            "\t2.  The Appellants subsequently applied and were granted permission to amend their grounds of appeal, which they did by notice dated 17 November 2006, filed in the Tribunal on 21 November 2006.",
            "\t3.  The  amended appeal comprised the following grounds:",
            "\t       i.    The Appellants had raised objections against the 1st Respondent’s approval on 14th June 2005 of the EIA report submitted by the 2nd Respondent, long before the 2nd Respondent started construction on the said plots;",
            "\t       ii.    The 1st Respondent neglected or failed to take action at that stage;",
            "\t       iii.    The 2nd Respondent gave false information to the 1st Respondent in support of the application for an EIA license;",
            "\t      iv.    The 1st Respondent neglected or failed to publish the 2nd Respondent's EIA application in the Kenya Gazette and in a local newspaper;",
            "\t       v.    The 2nd Respondent took advantage of the 1st Respondent's negligence or failure to take action and proceeded with construction of the proposed structures, now in dispute; and",
            "\t      vi.    Despite canceling the approval of the EIA Project Report (which the 1st Respondent did on 18th April 2006), the 1st Respondent did not exercise its powers to order demolition of the illegal structures and restoration of the environment.",
            "\t4.  The 1st Respondent filed a reply dated 16th of August 2006. They also filed a notice of preliminary objection challenging the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to grant the prayer sought and termed the Appeal as misconceived and legally unsound.",
            "\t5.  In the reply, the 1st Respondent also stated;",
            "\ti.    It had not approved any EIA report in relation to plot nos. 7158/385, 386, 387 and 388, the subject matter of the appeal;",
            "\tii.    There was no decision of the 1st Respondent for consideration by the Tribunal;",
            "\tiii.    The Tribunal was not the proper body to address any concerns, if at all  the Appellants had any, and that the issues framed were totally beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal;",
            "\tiv.   The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to make orders sought and must not be seen to act in vain;",
            "\tv.    The appeal by the Appellants was misconceived and an abuse of the Tribunal process as envisaged under the Environmental Management and Coordination Act; and",
            "\tvi.   The 1st Respondent finally urged the Tribunal to dismiss the Appeal with costs to the Respondents.",
            "\t6.  In its Ruling of 25 January 2007 on preliminary matters, the Tribunal disposed of the preliminary objections and decided that the matter proceeds to consideration on its merits.",
            "\t7.  The 2nd Respondent’s response was not by way of a formal rebuttal in pleadings. However, the 2nd Respondent submitted documents, and through evidence, responded as follows: -",
            "\t     i.   The approval granted by NEMA in their letter of 17 May 2005 addressed to the proponent remains valid;",
            "\t     ii.   The proponent has observed all the conditions 1,3,4,5 & 6 set out in NEMA's letter of approval and that condition No. 2 remains to be fulfilled;",
            "\t     iii.   The proponent having met the conditions and paid fees thereafter is entitled to have a license issued to it; and",
            "\t     iv.   The appeal be dismissed with costs to the 2nd Respondent.",
            "\t8   During the proceedings, the parties were represented as follows: the Appellants, by Mr. Richard Masinde, an employee of the Appellants; the 1st Respondent during the preliminary objection and subsequent hearing by Mr. Kibanga of Muchiri Munga and Kibanga Advocates, and the 2nd Respondent initially at the preliminary objections stage by Mr. Mureithi, Advocate, and later by Mr. Kibuchi of M/s. Kibuchi and Co Advocates.",
            "\t9.  The 1st Respondent, in their submission reiterated that: -",
            "\t    i.    The Appellants had sought no orders of the Tribunal directed at NEMA and the demolition which was requested would be directed at the 2nd Respondent.",
            "\t    ii.    The evidence of the Appellants’ witnesses alleging that the structures were illegally put up had been controverted by the witnesses of the 2nd Respondent.",
            "\t    iii.    The Tribunal should find that the 1st Respondent had discharged its obligations properly.",
            "\t   iv.    The Tribunal should make no order as to costs against the 1st Respondent.",
            "\t10.  To fully appreciate issues under contention, the Tribunal, along with counsel of the parties, visited the site on 12 February 2007. The land is sloppy with houses under construction; there is a river (Kibagare River) at the bottom where trees had been cut and stumps spread out and only a few old trees remained standing by partly built up houses. Counsel had been insistent that the Tribunal sees the site before hearing witnesses, and it did. Explanations were given at the site on various matters raised by the Tribunal members and the counsel.",
            "\t11.  Counsel also supplied additional documents, including: the 2nd Respondent’s bundle; the EIA Report to NEMA; and the interim report of Local Physical Development Plan, Policy Review for zones 3, 4 & 5, dated 3rd July 2006 by the Department of City Planning, City Council of Nairobi. Due to the late availability of the last mentioned of the documents, its import could not be fully argued. According to the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure, all documents to be relied upon should be filed on a timely basis.",
            "\t12.  Appellants called two witnesses, Yasmin T. Jadavji (a social worker and the Chairlady of the 2nd Appellant) and David T. Muchiri (Architect, registered with NEMA as an environmental expert). The 1st Respondent called one expert witness, James Kambo Mutusi, a consultant working in the firm that prepared the EIA Report, since the expert who prepared the report was said to be out of the country. The 2nd Respondent called two witnesses; Timothy S.G. Makunda, (former Director, Physical Planning Department in the Ministry of Lands and Settlement) and Kennedy Otieno Agwaro (Architect in private practice, working as a partner in the company that was responsible for the project). The City Council also provided, at the request of the Tribunal, an officer and friend of the Tribunal to clarify the policy of the City Council of Nairobi in Zone 5 where the project in question is located.",
            "\t13.  The Appellants’ witnesses explained the efforts they made to find out what was going on at the site, particularly when they saw a bulldozer pulling down trees and levelling the ground, and their efforts, through letters and visits to have NEMA explain what was going on. They also visited both the City Council and NEMA offices around March 2006. They were alarmed to find that plans and the EIA report were approved against a title that was non-existent having been surrendered 16 years ago. Both NEMA and the City Council were thereby misled. A certified copy of the title, LR number 7158/53 was produced.",
            "\t14.   The proponent had sought approval for 23 houses but 16 were approved by the City Council in February 2005. It was pointed out that by July the same year, another plan was approved against the same title for seven houses, bringing the total number of houses to be constructed on the site to 23. By Enforcement Notice dated 20th March, 2006, the council stopped construction of the 23 houses on the grounds, among others, that the developer had added 4 masionnetts, contrary to the approved building plans.",
            "\t15.   The number of houses approved for construction changed yet again, from 23 to  20. This followed a re-submission by the developer of new building plans which resulted, this time, in an approval for the construction of 20 masionettes by letter dated 21st September 2006, to which was attached a site plan showing three proposed houses not to be built.",
            "\t16.   The challenge by the residents was whether an area of 2 acres was environmentally suitable for holding as many houses as 20. The residents in the area protested against this and also against the way the EIA was carried out without proper public participation and due notices availed on site and in the media. They were hardly convinced that announcement in Kenya Times constituted due notice.",
            "\t17.   The witnesses for the 1st Respondents explained what they did, and exonerated themselves by stating that NEMA received the EIA report, and although against LR 7158/53, they had believed the title was still valid. NEMA had subsequently cancelled its approval by letter dated 17th May 2005, citing the fact that the 2nd Respondent had not accepted the approval conditions.",
            "\t18.   The 2nd Respondent’s witness, Mr Makunda explained the change of user process that they had carried out, culminating in an approval of change of user from single to multi-dwelling residential housing by the City Council of Nairobi on 29th November 2006. The witness also explained that the initial application for development permission had been on LR No. 7158/53. However, they were simultaneously pursuing amalgamation of four separate plots. Amalgamation was approved by the City Council on the same date aforesaid. The proponent’s witnesses contended that a change of user had been carried out and that the approvals were fully cognisant of the laws of the Council and in line with EMCA and the Regulations made thereunder.  ",
            "\t19.  It was alleged by the Appellants that the conditions by NEMA had hardly been observed by the proponent: a wetland had been interfered with, trees had been cut and appropriate distance from highest water mark ignored given that some houses were under construction too close to the river; construction of a swimming pool was also planned and green spaces were non-existent, in every case, replaced by concrete at the estimated ground coverage of 80-90 percent (Appellant’s estimation) including the houses. The Appellants expressed concern that the environment had been degraded by cutting trees without planting any as indicated in the EIA report.",
            "\t20.   The counsel for the Respondent and witness strenuously denied any wrong doing by the proponent and inadequate EIA report and consultations on the project with neighbours. They admitted that a few trees had been cut (about ten) and in the reports availed to the Council and NEMA the proponent had provided all information required for change of user, indicating the plots in question. The proponent, they argued, had broken no law, and the issues raised on slope, tree planting, planting creepers wall retention had been covered in the EIA report. The Respondents explained that trees and creepers would be planted in due course to avoid their damage during construction.",
            "\t21.  It was reiterated by the Respondent’s witnesses that current approval of design of houses is for twenty, based on four amalgamated plots. The place has a 9-inch sewer line that would carry liquid waste or waste water satisfactorily. It was further stated that the 6-metre riparian reserve underscored by NEMA’s conditions had been observed as well, as demonstrated by pegs that NEMA’s District Environment Officer had planted.",
            "\t22.  The witnesses explained that they had amalgamated four plots, one of which had been exchanged with another land owner in order to have one consolidated piece of land. These events were painstakingly explained to demonstrate there was no intention to conceal or falsify any information. But differences of view on applicable policy in Zone 5 remained. These were: the number of houses that could be built on the two acres; plinth area, ground coverage, and density applicable; the marshy wetlands -whether the marshy wetlands had been interfered with, and what to do with the three houses or so in that area; the amount of green spaces and play ground still available and whether a swimming pool need be constructed.",
            "\t23.  Even after the reduction of the number of houses from 23 to 20 at the top of the plot, leaving an area without houses, the houses constructed are practically along the riparian reserve, demanding therefore the determination if these houses should or should not be demolished. The Appellants maintained some houses be demolished while the proponent maintains adherence with the law has been observed and that policies are simply not binding as they are mere guidelines. The Appellants maintained that in any case approval of 20 houses by the Council is still valid.",
            "\t24.  The documentation availed and uncontested and in fact admitted showed that the EIA report had been approved and approval was conveyed to the Director, Houses and Plots Ltd. on 17 May 2005 by NEMA in its communication containing six mandatory conditions. This had been followed up with further letters from NEMA officials. For example letter dated 11th August 2005 by S. M. Langwen to the 2nd Respondent stated that “You are required to confirm in writing that the conditions of approval shall be complied with to enable the Authority process the EIA licence.” No evidence was adduced that the required confirmation was forthcoming. Two further letters of 17th March 2006 and 18th April 2006 by the NEMA Compliance Director and his deputy respectively stated that: -",
            "\ti)   “Ground investigations and complaints from the neighbours indicate that you have contravened the conditions set out in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) approval letter dated 17th May 2005. The Authority hereby orders you to STOP abstraction of water from river Mathari for construction Activities, STOP any further Construction within the riparian reserve.”",
            "\tii)   “Cancellation of Approval for the Environmental Impact Assessment Project Report...” “You have not consented to adherence of conditions of approval, you have contravened the conditions set out in the approval letter, there is substantial change in the manner the project is being implemented, you are advised to comply.”",
            "\t25.  Equally, the City Council of Nairobi, on the basis that the initial approval of plans had been granted on the basis of misleading information, nullified the approval. The relevant minutes, Town Planning Committee Minutes of 11/5/2006, paragraph 24 state as follows:",
            "\t“Under minutes 7(p1114) and 6 (p1459) of the meeting of this Committee held on 17th February 2005 and 23rd September 2005, approval was given for building plans registration Numbers DW795, DY 367 under items 205 and 301 respectively L.R. Number 7858/53.",
            "\tThe Director of City Planning reported that the plans were approved on wrong information since L.R. Number 7158/53 measuring about 1.328 hectares as per survey plan F/r number 3/637 of 1932 had been subdivided into six subplots and the same registered into separate titles in the early 1990's and hence L.R. Number 7158/53 had ceased to exist.",
            "\tHe recommended that the approval of the mentioned building plans be nullified. Resolved: That the recommendation of the Director of City Planning be approved. Action by Director of City Planning.”",
            "\t26.  Counsel for NEMA argued throughout that there was no NEMA decision that warranted its being involved in the appeal because at the time of filing the appeal, NEMA had cancelled the approval it had granted in May 2005. The 2nd Respondent argued that the cancellation/revocation was not in line with the law as per section 67(1) of EMCA. The Standards and Enforcement Review Committee ought to have been involved, to advise the Authority which earlier granted approval of EIA, subject to conditions and that upon acceptance, in writing of the conditions, a licence would be processed. No such reference to such a committee had been made. They argued therefore, that the approval is still valid.",
            "\t27.  Counsel for the 2nd Respondent summarised his argument thus: that the approval given by NEMA for the project report carried the same effect as a licence, because the proponent had done all that was required of it and the actual licence was a mere formality. In any case, the licence is not a mandatory document for the proponent to have before proceeding with implementation of the project. It should be noted that Regulation 28(1) reads “the Authority may issue the licence in Form 3”. The word used is “may” not “shall”. The issue of a licence under Regulation 28(1) is therefore not mandatory. The Authority having assured the proponent that all was in order, there was no further action required on the part of the proponent and the proponent accordingly proceeded with the project.",
            "\t28.  In its communication of 18th April 2006, NEMA had stated, among others things, that the proponent had not accepted the conditions, and most important that “you have contravened the conditions set out in the approval letter; there is substantial change in the manner the project is being implemented.” (underlined for emphasis). In the course of the proceedings the thrust of this letter was contested.",
            "\t29.   It is apparent from the evidence and documentation availed that some confusion did arise in submitting plans to the Council using a non-existent title – one that had been surrendered. In fact, the title had been submitted in support of two applications, for sixteen houses and for seven houses. The same title had been submitted along with the EIA report to NEMA. This matter caused suspicion and lack of understanding and transparency. ",
            "\t30.  The other issue was that while the City Council was the appropriate authority to approve the construction of the twenty houses other issues arise with respect to some other matters among them:",
            "\ti.    Whether NEMA was right in law to cancel approval of the EIA: whether because an approval no longer existed, NEMA was therefore off the hook on this matter;",
            "\tii.    Whether the riparian reserve was respected or not and the status of this practice;",
            "\tiii.    Whether demolition and new EIA study should be carried out or what other orders should be issued; and",
            "\tiv.  Whether there were consultations with the neighbours as required by law or not, during the EIA and change of user processes.",
            "\t31.  Once an EIA approval (whether or not conditional) has been given and an indication given that a licence is being processed by NEMA, is cancellation/revocation an option open to NEMA? There is no express provision on the matter. The EIA Regulations which provide for an EIA approval do not provide for cancelling or revoking an approval. However, Section 67(2) of EMCA provides that an EIA licence can be revoked, suspended or cancelled. On this analogy, it stands to reason that an approval can also be cancelled in appropriate cases. However, despite cancellation of a project approval, NEMA retains its regulatory role over the project or activities undertaken pursuant to approval. NEMA cannot abdicate its statutory responsibility as argued by their Counsel.",
            "\t32.  In addition, the provisions of section 64(1) .are that where a letter of approval leading to the processing of an EIA licence has been issued, the holder of such a licence (in this case, letter of approval and payment of licence fees and adhering to conditions) should submit a fresh EIA study within such time as the Authority may specify where-",
            "\ti.   there is substantial change or modification in the project or in the manner in which the project is being operated.",
            "\tii.   it is established that the information or data given by the proponent in support of his project application for an EIA licence under section 58 was false, inaccurate or intended to mislead.”",
            "\tThese two provisions were not invoked by NEMA.",
            "\t33.  NEMA stated as a justification for the cancellation of approval of the EIA Report that the 2nd Respondent failed to accept the conditions for approval. The proponent was requested to respond but admittedly did not do so.  What was the effect of the proponent’s non-response to NEMA’s approval conditions? The proponent simply proceeded with construction. It explained that through oversight, it did not write back. In the meantime the NEMA official in Westlands had visited the site and seen what was being done. It may not have been too much to explain before effecting the cancellation, that no response had been received. In the view of the Tribunal, this reason cannot be sustained.",
            "\t34.  The reasons given by NEMA for cancellation were not in line with the procedures laid down in EMCA and the Tribunal concurs with the 2nd Respondents’ Counsel. Such an approach in circumstances where nearly one year of actual work on the project has been undertaken, which was being implemented with NEMA’s knowledge, was neither justified nor lawful. Accordingly, the Approval is still valid.",
            "\t35.  It is also clear that if the proponent, had seen it fit, it could have, upon receipt of the letter of cancellation/revocation, which constituted adverse action by NEMA, lodged an appeal to NET challenging such a decision.",
            "\t36.   There was a question as to whether the riparian reserve had been observed and whether it is known in law. Observance of the riparian reserve was one of the conditions given by NEMA and has been a condition given consistently in developments alongside rivers. For example in A.T. Kaminchia vs. NEMA & M/S Bell Ways Garden Limited (Tribunal Appeal No. NET/05/2005 of 2005). In the present case, the Appellants averred that the reserve was not respected and that four houses were set to be put in the area. Firm land inside this area would mark the end of the reserve from the highest water mark as argued by the Appellants. The 2nd Respondent argued that they observed the reserve.",
            "\t37.   The issues were, however, firstly, the way to establish the reserve in the circumstances of a river that had been canalised on either side of the property, and that the 6-metre rule was a guideline and therefore not legally binding. Clearly how to fix this matter has been and is an issue of debate to be determined in the circumstances of each case. In the A.T. Kaminchia vs. NEMA & M/S Bell Ways Garden Limited, the Tribunal had recognised it. In the present case, NEMA official had placed sticks showing that the two houses already substantially constructed were outside the 6-meter area as measured from the middle of the river. Secondly, this condition had been given in NEMA's letter of 17th May 2005 and had not been challenged by the 2nd Respondent, who could not, at this stage, be contesting the validity of requiring the 6 metres. Thirdly, whatever the status of the practice may have been, it is currently no longer an issue. Legal Notice Number 120 of 2006, Water Quality Regulations Section 6 (b) provides that:",
            "\t“No person shall cultivate or undertake any development activity within full width of a river or stream to a minimum of six metres and a maximum of thirty metres on either side based on the highest recorded flood level.”",
            "\t38.  As the NEMA officer who visited the site had accepted that the two houses were outside the six-metre reserve and the proponent had acted on it to construct the houses, it is not necessary that the Tribunal pronounces itself on the point at this stage. It notes, however, that for the future, LN 120 of 2006 has settled the matter.",
            "\t39.  Turning to the question whether demolition, a new EIA or other orders should be issued, the Tribunal notes that investment in housing in cities and towns throughout Kenya has been and continues to be an important and critical matter. As public spaces and facilities are taken, legally or otherwise, reducing drastically green spaces and playgrounds for present and future generations, it becomes obvious that any complex of houses built together must integrate green spaces and facilities in such complexes. Considerations of financial gain have undermined this crucial principle, often times establishing a lesser facility in a swimming pool, in place of green spaces and facilities.",
            "\t40.  An upcoming project like the one under discussion has a moment to rectify such a weakness, if the Tribunal may so candidly refer to it so. In the redesign and engineering of walls that separate buildings and that are geared to arrest collapse of cuts in soil structures, and realign the complex attractively, vital environmental and health concerns should be fully integrated in shared public spaces for common management.",
            "\t41.  It is therefore incumbent on the cities, and elsewhere in the country, County Councils or Town Councils a long with NEMA and planning authorities under relevant legislation (caps 265, and 286) to exercise approval, supervisory and guidance roles to ensure that developers do not only scoop profits but offer prospective buyers facilities which their children and descendants could enjoy for many years, without incalculable problems arising from inadequate attention at planning and implementation stages.",
            "\t42.  The Appellants challenged the cut-and-fill method of leveling the ground, the steep slopes without retainer walls to prevent future collapses and without breaks to stop water rushing down and ending up in the river. They also challenged the distance between one property to another neighbouring property and wished that walls be reinforced to sustain weight from compacted soil and concrete. Another concern was the 9-inch sewer pipe, which may not, for long, sustain waste water from the increasing developments in the area. Other services, like water and electricity, are of concern because they are already strained. Traffic and noise are also of concern. They argued, therefore, that the Council and NEMA should ensure that appropriate laws and policies are stringently applied. In fact they stated the Council has not been applying or has been disregarding its laws.",
            "\t43.  NEMA received an EIA study, acknowledged its receipt and later wrote to the proponent communicating approval of the EIA Report on 17 May 2005 as stated herein. When an opportunity arose to ask for a new EIA report because of alleged substantive changes, NEMA did not take that option. Given the foregoing, should a new EIA study report be called for as urged of the Tribunal by the Appellants? The Appellants asked the Tribunal to do what NEMA should have done in law, and in this respect section 129(3) (b) provides that: “Upon any appeal, the Tribunal may: exercise any of the powers which could be exercised by the Authority in the proceedings in connection with which the appeal is brought.” The Tribunal is, therefore, empowered to step into the shoes of NEMA. The Tribunal has done so in some of previous appeals before it, and it will do so to the extent deemed necessary in this matter.",
            "\t44.  There was also the issue of public notification and participation. This is a principle of crucial importance. It is principle 10 of the Rio Declaration of 1992 to which Kenya, and the global community of nations subscribe. It is in national statute, EMCA; in several global and regional treaties that Kenya subscribes to, and plainly it should be put to practice in all development activities. In this case, it was explained, neighbours were contacted, billboards were displayed, and print media was used, albeit not the popular one and in small print. This may not have been adequate; perhaps this, in the perception of the Appellants, was inadequate. Nevertheless it was there. It was also stated that some ten or so neighbours were contacted, who, statedly, did not raise objections. ",
            "\t45.  The Appellants prayer for an order for restoration of this area to its original state must be responded to. It is given that in any development of the magnitude of this project, significant tampering with the site and environment would occur, and has occurred. Trees and vegetation have already been substantially uprooted, although the intention to plant some later is on record. Demolition can be ordered, and would be ordered if there is unequivocal and blatant disregard or breach of the law which has not, in this case, been established.",
            "\t46.  Upon site visit it was clear a lot of work had been done. It has now been stopped. It is to be observed that even in any case, the activity would stop as a matter of law upon an appeal being filed in the Tribunal. Section 129(4) of EMCA, provides unequivocally that:",
            "“Upon any appeal to the Tribunal under this section, the status quo of any matter or activity, which is the subject of the appeal, shall be maintained until the appeal is determined.” ",
            "\t47.  According to the 2nd Respondent, millions of shillings had been spent, and buyers are anxiously waiting to move in once the project is complete. These matters are not to be ignored. The Council makes by-laws and institutes measures to ensure that such laws are followed. The Council has responsibility to approve building plans submitted for that purpose; exercise supervisory role and take measures to ensure they are followed, or legal consequences flow from illegitimate actions. They review applications for change of user too. The argument was made before the Tribunal that the Council has been disregarding its own by-laws. There is no law that exempts the Council from implementing its own laws, and it cannot pick and choose which ones it applies, where and how, and which ones it does not.",
            "\t48.  The Council approved the 20 houses in November 2006, well after all the considerations of policy review in different zones, including Zone 5, the home of the project under consideration. This approval no doubt lifts the nullification that it had inflicted on the project in May 2006. In November 2006, it had also agreed to change of user. The EIA was approved on the basis of the previous title deed, but its relationship to the subsequent subdivision and references leave no doubt as to the property in question currently, or as it will be following amalgamation of the four resultant plots.",
            "\t49.  The Appellants’ point that the Building Code had not been complied with regarding new houses and distance to boundary wall (6m) was challenged, and in evidence the distance required was minimum 2.4 metres, which had been amply provided for. This contention therefore fails.",
            "\t50.  Arising from the above considerations and findings, the Tribunal unanimously, makes the following orders:-",
            "\ti.    NEMA was appropriately enjoined in these proceedings as a party;",
            "\tii.    The approval granted by NEMA in its letter of 17th May 2005 remains valid.",
            "\tiii.    Proponent takes measures in carrying out the contruction to ensure that there is no encroachment on the riparian reserve.",
            "\tiv.   In place of a swimming pool and a gym envisaged on the side of the river, an area be set aside for green space and play ground and such number of indigenous trees as the area may hold be planted;",
            "\tv.    The cut ground and retention walls be reinforced using designs by competent engineers to ensure that no erosion or landslide occurs in the future; and that this be duly supervised by the City Council of Nairobi and NEMA to their satisfaction;",
            "\tvi.  The mitigation measures in the Project Report be strictly adhered to;",
            "\tvii.  Further delay should be avoided and activities on site can be resumed, along with the precautionary measures; and",
            "\tviii.  The EIA licence be and is hereby issued.",
            "\t51.   The 1st respondent did not seek for any costs from the appellants and this is commendable. On the other hand, the 2nd Respondent did request the Tribunal to order the costs incurred by them be paid. This has been a complex matter, with many issues of public interest canvassed in the Tribunal. Accordingly, the Tribunal declines to award costs and orders the Appellants and the 2nd Respondent each to bear their costs.",
            "\t52.   The Tribunal draws the attention of the parties to the provisions of section 130 of EMCA.",

            "By their Notice of Appeal dated 26th April 2006, the Appellants Narok County Council and the Kenya Tourism Federation (hereinafter the Appellants) filed an appeal against NEMA, 1st Respondent, and Wasafiri Camp Ltd, the 2nd Respondent, (hereinafter the Respondents) challenging NEMA’s environmental impact assessment (EIA) certificate of approval to the developer, the 2nd Respondent, as contrary to EIA Regulations. They requested the Tribunal to set aside the approval by NEMA and to order the 2nd Respondent not to continue any development activities at the project site. In their reply of 15th May 2006 the Respondents urged the Tribunal to dismiss the appeal with costs. The regulations are contained in legal Notice No. 101 of 2003, of Environmental Management and Coordination Act (EMCA), No. 8, of 1999. The developer had sought to construct a lodge / camp in the environs of the Maasai Mara Game Reserve; outside the Game Reserve.",
            "Two Interveners sought and obtained authority to participate in the appeal as interested and affected parties. These were Ben Kipeno, and other four affected parties as landowners, namely Mr. Mutaka Ole Mpooya, owner of CIS Mara/Koiyaki/Dagurugurueti/280, Mr. Martin Ole Mariko owner of CIS Mara/ Koiyaki/ Daguruguruet/281, Mr. Korio Ole Naimodu owner of CIS Mara/ Koiyaki/ Daguruguruet/294 and Mr. Lesiomon Sale owner of CIS/Koiyaki/Daguruguruet/2601. They filed their notice on 15 May 2006 contesting the right of the Appellants and the Tribunal to deal with the appeal. The other interested party that also joined in the proceedings was the Kenya Investment Authority (KIA).",
            "The 1st Appellant, Narok County Council, was represented by Moitalel Ole Kenta Advocate, of Kenta, Moitalel and Co. Advocates; the 2nd Appellant, Kenya Tourist Federation, by Senior Counsel Fred Ojiambo Advocate of Kaplan and Stratton; the 1st Respondent, by Mereka of Mereka and Co. Advocates; the 2nd Respondent, Wasafiri Camp Ltd, by the law firm, Robson Harris and Company Advocates; respectively by Mrs Jane Mwangi, Advocate (early stages of the hearing and preliminary objections); Maurice O. Makoloo, Advocate and Lazarus Odongo Ogembo Advocate which firm and team also represented the affected parties (as Interveners) in the proceedings. Finally the Kenya Investment Authority (KIA) was represented by Ms. Caroline Oyula of the Attorney General Chambers.",
            "In the course of its hearings on 19th June, 22nd  June, 27th July, 10th August, 18th  August (site visit), 6th  September, 19th  September, 13th October and 14th  November and 27th November 2006 (When the Counsels made their final submissions), the Tribunal heard witnesses as indicated herein. The 1st Appellant called the Clerk to the Narok County Counsel, Mr. Wilson Mwita Maroa; the Senior Game Warden Mr. Michael Koikai, Mr. Samson Parsimei Lenjirr. The 2nd Appellant called two witnesses, Mrs. Arundhati Inamdar–Willetts, EIA expert and Jonathan Briston Scott of BBC. The 1st Respondent called three Expert witnesses: Augustine Omwamba, geologist, working with Ministry of Water and Irrigation for 21years, the lead EIA expert, Dr. Ciira Kiiyukia, Lecturer at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) and Mr. Maurice Mbegera, Director, Compliance and Enforcement Department of NEMA. The 2nd Respondent called no witness but embraced the evidence of the 1st Respondent’s witnesses. They had intended to call one witness, Ben Kipeno but ultimately did not call him. The interested parties called a community representative, Mr. Joseph T. Nabaala who read a statement. KIA did not call any witness.",
            "The Tribunal and the team of lawyers and parties visited the project site on 18th  August 2006 and saw the surrounding areas. It heard part evidence from the Senior Game Warden, Michael Koikai, who completed his evidence in Nairobi and also heard some statement, and received copies of the same, from the community representative.",
            "In addition to witnesses, nearly all experts, called to the Tribunal to present evidence and clarify issues, all the Counsel in this matter generously presented bundles of documentation and materials in support of their respective positions. The materials included several statutes and legal Notices respecting some of the statutes: the Local Government Act, Cap 265; the Physical Planning Act, Cap 286; the Registered Land Act, Cap 300; The Land Control Act, Cap 302; The Investment Act, 2004 and amendments thereto; legal authorities from local and foreign jurisdictions; scientific books and articles, among others.",
            "The 1st Appellant by a further Notice of Appeal dated 23rd June 2006, elaborated the grounds of appeal as indicated below (paragraph 8 ) specifying action appealed against as based on NEMA’S approval letter dated 8th March 2006, in particular conditions numbers 3, 4 and 5 namely:",
            "“3. The proponent shall comply with the relevant principal laws, by-laws and guidelines issued for development of such a project within the jurisdiction of Narok County Council, Ministry of Tourism, Kenya Wildlife Service and other relevant Authorities.",
            "  4. The proponent shall ensure that environmental protection facilities or measures to prevent pollution and ecological deterioration such as waste disposal facilities are designed, constructed and employed simultaneously with the proposed project.",
            "  5. The proponent shall ensure that during the construction phase, the operation adhere to Legal Notice No. 40. The Factories (Buildings Operations and Work of Engineering Construction) Rules, 1984.”",
            "The grounds of appeal by the 1st Appellant dissatisfied with the first Respondent’s decision in its 8th March letter, stated as follows:- (i) that the 1st Respondent did not, within fourteen days after receipt of the EIA study report invite the public to make oral or written comments on the report by publishing in the Kenya Gazette and in a newspaper with nationwide circulation, and making announcements of the Notice in both official and local languages in a radio with nationwide coverage, (ii) that it did not hold any public hearing on the project or seek the participation of major stakeholders and affected persons such as the Appellant, Kenya Wildlife Service, (KWS), Kenya Association of Tour Operators (KATO) and others adding (iii) that they were neither consulted nor their ‘no objection’ requirement sought and obtained; (iv) that it did  not address itself to the very issue of cumulative environmental impact the project would have on the environmentally very fragile Maasai Mara ecosystem before the approval; (v) that it ignored the advice of its own technical team that visited the area and strongly recommended against any interference with the natural status of the area which is a breeding area of the Leopard among other fauna; (vi) that the 2nd Respondent did not seek the views of persons who may be affected by the project during the process of conducting EIA study by posting posters in strategic public places within the area, publishing a notice in a newspaper with nationwide circulation, making announcements of the notice in both official and local languages in a radio with nationwide coverage and by holding public meetings with affected parties and  communities; and (vii) that the 2nd Respondent, invoking the 1st Respondent’s approval of EIA report, carried out unapproved development of Wasafiri Camp contrary to and/or without complying with the mandatory conditions contained therein. That is, (viii) without complying with the relevant principal laws, by-laws and guidelines operational within the jurisdiction of the Appellant and other relevant authorities. This statement was further elaborated in eight statements thus: carrying on the construction of  the Camp without the consent of the area Land Control Board as to the leasing and change of user from agricultural to commercial purposes, carrying out said construction without first applying for and obtaining presidential exemption from the relevant provisions of the Land Control Act (Chapter 302 of the Laws of Kenya",
            "asafiri Ltd.’s members are not all Kenyan citizens, carrying on the development of the project without first seeking and obtaining development authority and approval from the Appellant, carrying on with the said project without consultation with and approval of other lead Agencies, carrying the development without first seeking and obtaining a certificate of compliance and the approval of the Director of Physical Planning (per the Physical Planning Act, Cap 286); obtaining an investment certificate to develop a project within an environmentally fragile ecosystem without first fulfilling all the requirements of the relevant Kenyan statutes, drilling a borehole without authority from the Water Resources Management Authority (Water Act, 2002) and generally carrying on an illegal construction capable of causing irreversible pollution and ecological deterioration of the fragile Maasai Mara ecological system.",
            "The 2nd Appellant  also aggrieved by the 1st Respondent’s decision in its letter of 8th March 2006, elaborated its grounds of appeal filed on 7th July 2006 contesting the decision thus: (i) that it approved the 2nd Respondent’s EIA project report for the proposed Wasafiri Camp despite the fact that the project report did not comply with the requirements of the Environmental Impact Assessment and Audit Regulations, (ii) that it approved the said project report while it was aware that the report was not satisfactory as it did not provide a site plan showing all structures including staff houses, that public participation was not adequate as major stakeholders and affected persons such as KWS, the 1st Appellant, KATO and others were not consulted and the report did not indicate the cumulative environmental impacts of the project in the Maasai Mara ecosystem, (iii) that it made the said decision despite the fact that the 2nd Respondent did not take any measures to rectify the shortcomings of the project report when required to do so. That the 1st Respondent (iv) should have, in the circumstances, found that an Environmental Impact Assessment Study was necessary before issuing an EIA licence, (v) that the 1st Respondent failed to consider the ecological effect of the proposal on the Mara ecosystem, and (vi) in making its decision it completely disregarded the objections and views given to it by various stake holders and affected parties. It also (vii) ignored the recommendations of its technical team presented to it in the site visit report dated 8th February 2006. Thus it (viii) acted contrary to its objects and functions as prescribed in the Environment Management and Coordination Act (EMCA).",
            "The 1st Respondent filed two replies dated 26th May 2006 and 29th June 2006. It denied each and every allegation, unless expressly admitted, and in particular contested that the 1st Appellant had locus standi to prefer an appeal under section 129 of EMCA.  Additionally, it challenged that the Game Warden, as Appellant’s representative, had powers to so proceed under the Local Government’s Act, Cap 265. As filed, therefore, the 1st Respondent averred that the appeal did not disclose a reasonable cause of action as such an appeal was not contemplated under section 129(1) of EMCA. In the first response it averred that “it was satisfied as to the adequacy of the EIA project report and that all the relevant concerns by all stakeholders were borne in mind before the requisite approval was given subject to terms and conditions it considered appropriate and which the 2nd Respondent have confirmed acceptance.”",
            "In its response filed on 29th June 2006, the 1st Respondent avers that the procedure and steps followed in approving the 2nd Respondent’s application for an EIA licence was proper in terms of the provisions of Regulations 9 and 10(2) of the EIA and Audit Regulations, 2003(Legal Notice 101); and as per Regulations 9 and 10(2), they do not provide for the conducting of a public hearing while a project proponent is preparing an EIA project report. Further, these Regulations (9 & 10(2)) do not provide for an advertisement of the EIA project report to call for public comments. It denied that it did not seek comments on the EIA project report from relevant lead agencies, and as in the first response of May 2006, reaffirms its satisfaction as to the adequacy of the EIA project report and the process effected thereto. During hearing on 10th August 2006 counsel for NEMA noted that the grounds of appeal for 2nd Appellant, to which they had not replied, were similar to those of 1st Appellant and therefore should be taken as responded to in the replies earlier filed which was not objected to.",
            "The 2nd Respondents and Interveners, also referred to as the affected parties, filed their responses on 15th May 2006. The 2nd Respondent raised four preliminary issues objecting to the appeal which it termed incompetent on the ground that the Appellants have no locus standi or right in law to prefer an appeal under section 129 of EMCA. In addition it challenged the power of a Game Warden to prefer or file the appeal on behalf of the Narok County Council.  (As stated in paragraph 14 below, this contention was upheld by the Tribunal in its Ruling on this preliminary objection of 22nd June 2006.) And in any case its appeal was based on false information, the Respondent concluded.",
            "The affected party, one Ben Kipeno, whose land, along with another four land owners, has been leased for the construction of the proponent’s project also aver in their pleading that the project is on private land leased for the purpose of constructing a lodge, and raise objections, on constitutional grounds. They state that the appeal “is not preferred for the legitimate purpose of preserving the environment.” It is preferred “for the predominant and illegitimate purpose of advancing exploitative tendencies or practices of the parties who have brought pressure on the Appellants to lodge the Appeal.” In a further submission of 19th June, 2006 the affected parties objected on constitutional grounds and on sanctity of private contracts and contested that the Appellants, as third parties to the contracts, had a basis in law to intervene in the appeal.",
            "The 1st Appellant strongly contested the preliminary objections which the Tribunal had in accordance with its Rules of Procedure, Legal Notice No. 191 of 2003, to first address before turning to substantive considerations of the matter. The parties – 1st Appellant and the Respondents and affected parties – through their counsels orally and in writing addressed the Tribunal on 19 June 2006 on the issue of jurisdiction and preliminary objections. The Tribunal, on 22nd June, 2006 issued its Ruling which, while finding the appeal of the 1st Appellant prosecuted by a Game Warden incompetent, but capable of ratification by the Narok County Council if it so wished, found that the appeal could continue on basis of the appeal by the 2nd Appellant.",
            "The 2nd Respondent on 8th August 2006 filed grounds of appeal in reply to Appellants’ statements of grounds of appeal, after the determination of the preliminary objections. In detailed response, paraphrased hereunder, the Respondent challenged the statement of grounds of appeal by the Appellants, each in turn. Respecting the first Appellant, the opening ground is challenged as “utterly incompetent and does not lie” as it treats the project report by EIA expert Ciira Kiiyukia & his colleague, Samuel Gaitungu, as an EIA study report which it was not, and therefore the challenge was to a wrong document. The Respondent avers it prepared and submitted to the 1st Respondent a project report with details as required in the Legal Notice, (LN 101 of 2003). Upon receipt of the project report, the 1st Respondent was not under statutory obligation to invite members of the public to make oral or written comments, or to advertise in media or radio in official or local languages. There was no obligation under the law to conduct a public hearing either, upon receipt of a project report, or to invite “major stakeholders” to participate in a debate.",
            "With respect to grounds of appeal by both Appellants, the 2nd Respondent disputes what is averred about the “major stakeholders” or “affected persons”, considers it unsustainable; and false; that the grounds do not constitute a dispute that can be adjudicated by the Tribunal as no clear environmental issues have been legitimately, procedurally and legally put forward to the Tribunal; that by their nature and content the statements of the grounds of appeal are “replaced with emotive and personal business interests disguised as environmental concerns that cannot hold vis a vis the benefit of expertise provided by an expert opinion on the impact of the environment”; avers that the qualifications of the EIA experts are legitimate and have not been challenged or called into question by the Appellants, and hence no basis had been laid in the grounds of appeal to discredit the project report.",
            "Further, with respect to the 2nd Appellant’s grounds of appeal, and generally the 2nd Respondent attacks them as “irrelevant and vexatious” and as “having no basis in law as no relief is sought” from the Tribunal, and introduces the matter of Investment Certificate applied for and obtained from the Kenya Investment Authority, subject to its compliance with laws relating to environment, health and security. The 1st Respondent, having considered environmental issues, approved the proposed development whereupon the KIA authorised implementations of the project. Thus the 2nd Respondent complied with the laws desired of it respecting environment, health and security. In particular having been issued with a letter of approval by the 1st Respondent, and accepted the terms thereof and addressed them, it was not required to undertake an EIA study, and hence the requirement to advertise, solicit public participation did not arise and all legal and environmental issues had been satisfactorily addressed. The 2nd Respondent finally states categorically that from the project report itself that “whereas there is likely to be some environmental impact in relation to the proposed development, there are and have been disclosed sufficient mitigation measures to deal with the same “as envisaged in EMCA. Further the letter of approval given to it by the 1st Respondent was “granted properly, legitimately, procedurally and in accordance with the law.”",
            "The 1st Appellant’s witnesses explained the grievances of the Narok County Council which was aggrieved as a result of the 1st Respondent’s decisions to issue an approval letter (8 March 2006) for the 2nd Respondent to continue with a development in the Maasai Mara, within the jurisdiction of the Appellant. It contended that the approval was issued prematurely “as the proponent was supposed to and should have strictly adhered to the Regulations”, (Reg. 10(2); 10(3)) which was contested by the 1st and 2nd Respondents. The sentiments of the 1st Appellant were strongly reinforced by the Counsel of the 2nd Appellant. The witnesses for the 1st Appellant, (The Clerk and the Senior Warden) did not find the application to the Council regular. They had received an application by one, Ben Kipeno, on 6 February 2006 for approval of a development of a Camp, Wasafiri Camp, on parcel 295. The Council had not received any other application, and this was put on the agenda of and considered by the Game and Veterinary Committee of the Council on 22nd February 2006; Min No. 13/06, unconfirmed, indicated. The Clerk explained the process of approval of Minutes in the Council, by the full Council, a process he said had not been completed by the time of the hearing. He indicated unconfirmed minutes are not binding on the Council or any party. He confirmed that no plans to construct the Camp had been submitted to the Council and consequently none had been approved. Asked why the Council addressed Wasafiri Ltd – rather than B. Kipeno, who had applied – while it had never submitted an application to it, he stated it was simply an oversight, and denied there was an approval for Wasafiri Ltd. He mentioned that the proposed construction – later initiated and obviously above ground level – had prompted several complaints and named several complainants – Governor’s Camp, BBC Nature History Unit Broadcasting House, Cheli & Peacock and Ol Tome Safaris Ltd. There had been a discussion with someone from Wasafiri Ltd, but he did not remember who and no minutes were kept either. There was another irregularity: the EIA project report had not been received by the Council.",
            "The Clerk stated that the development in question should indicate who the investors were, Kenyan, or non Kenyan and B. Kipeno had not so indicated. The Council only knew on 14th June 2006 on carrying out a search. The Clerk was stringently questioned by Counsel, but maintained that NEMA had had no contact with them. He stated that, applications to the Council are not transferable, say from Kipeno to another party, and that the approval for Kipeno was a campsite, and if he set up a company, it would have to apply for approval/permission a new. As to how other parcels were added, he explained it happened in the Committee by member whom he could not name; there had been no other applications except Kipeno’s.",
            "In raising other questions of approval process in the Council such as whether plans had been received or considered by the physical planning committee; change of use had been applied for and considered; issues of Land Control Board consent or exemption; ability to dispose and lease private land, it emerged that various processes had not been completed under respective laws as stipulated in the conditions of approval. While draft Agreements of Leases by Kipeno and others had been attached, they had hardly been processed; nor were they established to be actually valid.",
            "The evidence given by NEMA, while stating that the Council was contacted was by no means unequivocal. Indeed a letter was, on the face of it, sent to lead agencies and undoubtedly the Narok County Council was one of the agencies. However, the letter was addressed to Mara County Council, obviously a mistake and no correction was produced in the Tribunal. In the view of the Tribunal, the Clerk and other Council officers would have no reason to deny receipt of the consultation on the EIA project report. Besides in its letter of 18 January 2006 to Wasafiri Ltd. NEMA acknowledged expressly that “public participation was not adequate as major stakeholders such as KTF, the Narok County Council and KWS were not consulted.”",
            "During the evidence given by other experts (Koikai, Lenjir), the visiting NEMA team saw a borehole drilled and operational; housing started and structures, construction for sewage noted; saw caves, fig trees. The caves were used by leopards as breeding areas, and fig trees for cover of the leopards, it was stated in evidence. It emerged that all that work had been carried out by the proponent, the 2nd Respondent, by late March 2006. The witnesses and Council were not aware that the EIA had been done, and on observing these developments the witnesses had reported to the Council. When last on site there was no construction in early April 2006; construction had taken place after stop order was issued on 26th  April 2006 which the proponent denied.",
            "The witness representing the Community read out a statement blaming the dispute on business competition in the place; thus it was not really environmental. He had written the statement drawing on views of the community representatives around. He admitted pertinent laws, including environmental, had to be followed. The community members had then signed. On record were differing views from the members of various communities. Some for and others against the development. From amongst the communities only Joseph Nabaala presented the statement and responded to questions from some Counsel and Tribunal members.",
            "Other expert witnesses, Mr. Omwamba, Mr. Mbegera, Dr. Ciira Kiiyukia, Mrs. Willetts and Mr. Scott also testified. Mr. Omwamba, the geologist, had surveyed and sited the borehole; he was not concerned, it was admitted, with environmental aspects but with water source and the quality of water. He, in fact, was unaware of the fig trees and their significance to leopards. Dr. Ciira, likewise, was unfamiliar with the area; its uniqueness to leopards, and the gorge. He did not note, and learn about their ecological significance in his (10.00 am to 3.00 pm) five or so hour visit. He talked to the people that were on site and to no experts on the Mara ecosystem or its ecology. The EIA project report was the first he had done on wildlife ecology and had not in fact toured around. He had not been back; was briefed by someone, not the proponent, and was next seized with the matter when requested to reply or respond to the NEMA letter of 31st  January 2006 on the issue of cumulative impacts of the area. He had then summarised what was presented in his EIA project report in other words. He defended his EIA project report, while admitting he was not an ecologist and was not versed in Mara ecosystem. He was a food technologist. Mrs. Willetts and Mr. Scott, on the other hand, knew the area and its ecology; were passionate about it and concerned about the new development in the very unique place that ought not to be unduly disturbed. While they had not been there in the past two years or so, they considered the Mara ecosystem should be carefully analysed in the EIA study and largely preserved for posterity. Their evidence was unshaken, in the view of the Tribunal. Mr. Scott talked to his “Big Cats” works that he has authored summing up his observations for decades in the area, and the lead expert was apparently unaware of these.",
            "Mr. Maurice Mbegera, for NEMA, testified on this matter, referring extensively to NEMA’s letter of 8 March 2006, approving an EIA licence to the 2nd Respondent, with several conditions, NEMA sent a technical team of several experts to the site and the team made a report with the following recommendations:",
            "         i.    The proponent acted illegally by sinking a borehole before NEMA approval;",
            "         ii.    The management for 25 tents in such a place would be a great challenge given the rocky nature of the surface;",
            "        iii.    This is s sensitive wildlife habitat and should NOT be disturbed in any way;",
            "        iv.    The proponent should look for an alternative site within or without the 500 acres leased as far as possible from this habitat;",
            "         v.    The expert to be summoned by NEMA to explain some false reports given in the report and for not doing PCC on such a sensitive project and for not advising the proponent properly. There was doubt as to whether he visited the site;",
            "        vi.    NEMA to urgently raise the matter of mushrooming camps around the reserve with KWS, Narok County Council to ensure that important wildlife habitat around the reserve is not destroyed, and",
            "       vii.    The proponent should provide a detailed site plan, undertake PPC involving all stakeholders.",
            "Mr. Mbegera said that these, though not taken in every respect, were considered. The recommendations were, in any case, advisory to NEMA. By the team’s visit, a borehole had already been sunk. The witness had, though he did not recall the date, also visited the site. NEMA had written to the proponent on 31st January 2006 asking for additional input, namely site plan showing all structures including staff houses, public participation was not adequate as major stakeholders and affected persons such as KWS, Narok County Council, KATO and others were not consulted and indicating to the cumulative environment impacts of the project in the Maasai Mara ecosystem which had been availed on February 21, 2006. NEMA had also received Dr. Ciira Kiiyukia’s EIA project report and shared it as required by law. He denied that the report had not been fully considered and explained the requirements of an EIA project report and an EIA study report, which have different consequences under the law, that is the Environmental Impact Assessment (and Audit) Regulations, Legal Notice 101 of 2003.",
            "The Mara ecosystem had attained fame in wildebeest and other animals annual migrations into and from Tanzania that bring untold number of tourists and enormous financial resources, in addition to world fame not only to Kenya, East Africa and the Region. This heritage if threatened, would compromise the pillars of sustainable development in socio-cultural, economic and environmental sustainability. Any investments in the area, while welcome, must balance all interests on a sustainable basis: not just immediate financial benefits.",
            "The Tribunal has, in the light of the appeal, arguments, evidence and material before it to determine whether NEMA, did fully comply with EMCA and its Regulations strictly in its letter of 8th March 2006 approving a grant of an EIA licence to the 2nd Respondent, Wasafiri Camp Ltd, to develop the project site.",
            "The response to the above question should be able to dispose this matter which attracted two Appellants; two Respondents, and two interveners/interested parties – Ben Kipeno and others, and the Kenya Investments Authority (KIA). The matter is significant, attracting five distinguished Counsel, and several experts, and putting forward several interests at not only local level, but well beyond; entanglement of environmental considerations, investment, tourism, fauna and flora and ecosystem in an area described as unique, fragile ecosystem and acknowledged as of immense global attraction.",
            "Both Appellants forcefully argued, and urged the Tribunal to agree, that NEMA did not strictly adhere to its Regulations. NEMA contends it did, and having followed all the steps, procedures, EMCA and its Regulations. It therefore was entitled to grant a letter of approval to the 2nd Respondent, Wasafiri Camp Ltd. In this respect the 2nd Respondent agrees with the 1st Respondent, as do the Interveners.",
            "Should NEMA have asked for an EIA project report or a study report from the 2nd Respondent? It is not in dispute that what was presented to NEMA by the lead expert, Dr. Ciira Kiiyukia, on behalf of himself and his colleague, Samuel Gaitungu for the 2nd Respondent was an Environmental Impact Assessment Project Report. And as an EIA project report, the rigours stipulated in the Regulations of gazettement, radio announcements in official and local languages etc are not required. The report, though, would be submitted to lead agencies, among others (Regulation 9 (1) and 9 (2)). The Respondents and interested parties would, therefore, be and are correct in contesting the 1st Appellant’s ground of appeal in this respect. Strictly on basis of an EIA project report all the measures outlined by the 1st Appellant need not have been undertaken.",
            "However, the 1st Appellant has argued that this determination by NEMA was premature and a full EIA study should have been required of the proponent. This was also urged of the experts called by the Appellants given the sensitive and fragile nature and uniqueness of the Mara ecosystem whose ecological sensitivity NEMA acknowledged and which the Tribunal unhesitatingly accepts. They therefore invoke Regulation 10(2) and 10(3), and argue, quite rightly, that the full EIA study should have been determined. NEMA knows of the ecological sensitivity of the Maasai Mara ecosystem, no doubt, and so affirmed as of the 18th January 2006 in its letter to Wasafiri Ltd wherein it stated that “ the EIA  project report for the above mentioned development has been reviewed and due to ecological sensitivity to the Maasai Mara area an EIA study is required.” Counsel for the 2nd Appellant was quite emphatic in paragraph 2.3 of his submission on 27 November 2006. [Underlining is for emphasis only].",
            "“While, as it will be demonstrated later in these submissions, it is possible to analyse the project report so as to show that NEMA was correct in its ruling that the project report had not met the required standard and was for rejection, as indeed it was rejected, that letter of 18th January, 2006 by itself alone is proof that NEMA had reviewed the project report and found that it did not comply with the requirements of the NEMA regulations. Therefore, perhaps more than anything else, this letter highlights the impropriety and invalidity of the purported approval given on 8th March, 2006.”",
            "In view of the above, the option of the letter by NEMA to Wasafiri Ltd., the 2nd Respondent on 31 January 2006 requiring a response on the shortcomings of the project report was not any longer open to NEMA, and Wasafiri Ltd., aware of the situation should, rather, have lodged an appeal as per Regulations 10 (4) and 46, which, unfortunately, it did not.  Instead the 2nd Respondent, in its letter of 21 February 2006, replied to NEMA, by sending a report prepared by the lead expert on the point of cumulative environmental impact. The question to ask at this stage is: did the cumulative environmental impact report prepared and actually sent to NEMA constitute a response, though apparently accepted by NEMA? Expert witness Mrs. Arundhati Inamdar-Willetts was of the opinion that it did not. And independent of this opinion, the author of the report on this aspect confirmed that it was not really a new report or effort. EIA Expert Ciira Kiiyukia, in response to a question in the Tribunal, admitted that he prepared the report, which was simply a summary of what the EIA project report contained; there was no new information but rather it was the same substance clothed in different words. In the view of the Tribunal, the report did not properly constitute a report on the cumulative environmental impacts.",
            "The Counsel of all the parties diligently prosecuted the various grounds of appeal; the adequacy and, format of the EIA project report, the process used or not used by the players; the consultations among the lead agencies and other interests, the laws and processes observed or not adequately observed and their effects. These laws were cited, as were Court cases from local jurisdiction and abroad. But having reached the finding and conclusion that an EIA study be carried out, should the Tribunal carry on further analysis of the issues and material and pronounce itself on the merits of the aspects? Would it serve a purpose at this point except interfere with the process of the EIA study report and the mandate and responsibility of NEMA? This it should not do. In the view of the Tribunal, the answer to the question is in the negative. No additional reinforcement to the conclusion that an EIA study report and the process provided by the law of EMCA and its Regulations is needed and NEMA should be let to do its work, and it is so let. The proponent, likewise, should be let to do  its work on the EIA study report the way it is required to do as per the Regulations.",
            "On one matter though, an observation should be made. That is on the Investment Certificate issued by the Kenya Investments Authority (KIA) that the Counsel for the 2nd Respondent and the Counsel for the KIA stringently sought to uphold. The certificate, no. 0105 of 2nd March 2006, was issued subject to observing environmental, health and security laws, as also argued by Counsel for the Appellants and indeed Counsel for KIA noted that to the extent environmental concerns are not met, KIA would respect that. In effect this Ruling has determined that a full environmental impact assessment study be carried out. Accordingly, the condition that the project should comply with the laws relating to the environment is yet to be met.",
            "The Tribunal, having reviewed this matter, unanimously, makes the following orders:",
            "(i)     Sets aside and quashes the decision of NEMA contained in its letter of 8 March 2006 conveying its approval of the EIA Project Report to the 2nd Respondent for the development of Wasafiri tented Camp on parcels 295, 294, 296 and 2061, the project site, in Mara Division, Narok.",
            "(ii)     That the proponent do prepare a full Environmental Impact Assessment study report in accordance with EMCA and its Regulations, and until such a study is completed, its report submitted to NEMA and NEMA has made its determination thereon, directs that no further development activity takes place at the project site or its environs.",
            "The Appellants have asked for costs of this appeal of the Respondents, and the latter have asked the same of the Appellants. Also asking for the costs of the Appellants is the Intervener, KIA. The other intervener, the affected parties, have not but rather have asked the Tribunal to refer the matter to the Attorney General for criminal offences to be preferred against the Appellants in the appropriate forum as the Tribunal has no such jurisdiction. In this respect, the Tribunal declines to award any costs and orders each party and intervener (KIA) to bear its own costs. The complexity, significance of the subject matter persuades the Tribunal to that effect. The Tribunal also declines to proceed as urged by the intervener, affected parties, in this matter.",
            "The Tribunal draws the attention of the Parties and the Interveners to the provisions of Section 130 of EMCA.",
            "Finally the Tribunal expresses its deep appreciation to all the Counsel for the Parties and the Interveners for their diligence in prosecuting this appeal.",

            "\t1. On 27th September 2017 the court recorded orders by consent of the parties, as dictated by Prof. Ojienda for the petitioner, and confirmed by Mr. Kibicho for the 1st and 2nd respeondents, Mr. Marete for the 3rd respondent and Mrs. Rugaita for the 4th respondent, in the following terms -:",
            "\t‘By consent of all parties:",
            "1. That the KIEMS Kits held for the gubernatorial elections for Embu County for Manyatta, Mbeere South, Mbeere North and Runyenjes Constituencies be released to IEBC, the 1st respondent, for the purpose of conducting the repeat presidential election;",
            "2. That the data from the said KIEMS Kits be stored by the 1st respondent as by law obligated for purposes of the hearing of this petition;",
            "3. That the IEBC do access the premises in Mbeere South, Mbeere North, Runyenjes and Manyatta Constituencies for the purpose of securing the KIEMS Kit;",
            "4. That subject to availability of space within Embu law courts, the 1st respondent, in consultation with and in the presence of 2 representatives of the petitioner and 2 representatives for the 3rd and 4th respondents, do secure, transport and store all the election materials within the premises availed at Embu Law Courts, and the said material be preserved in terms of the orders made on 28th August 2017;",
            "5. That the Deputy Registrar of the High Court do supervise the process of movement and storage of all the materials, and do thereafter file a report in court;",
            "6. That the parties shall undertake this process within seven (7) days commencing on 29th September 2017. The matter to be mentioned on 29th September 2017 before the Deputy Registrar, Embu High Court;",
            "7. That the 3rd and 4th respeondents shall be at liberty to place their seals on the ballot boxes before they are moved to the court;",
            "8. That that after movement of the election materials to the court for storage, the premises shall be available to the 1st respondent.’",
            "\t2. The matter was mentioned on 29th September 2017 before the Deputy Registrar in compliance with the consent order, when the matter was given a further mention date for 2nd October 2017. There was no mention on 2nd October 2107, the matter was instead mentioned on 4th October 2017, when it was agreed by consent that the orders of 28th September 2017 would be executed on 11th and 12th October 2017. ",
            "\t3. When the matter came up on 11th October 2017, a disagreement arose relating to interpretation of the orders of 27th September 2017. Mr. Nyamu, counsel for the petitioner, took the position that the petitioner was ready for implementation of orders 1, 2 and 3 of the consent order, but was of the view that the rest of the orders were no longer tenable on account of changed circumstances, to wit the unavailability of space at the law courts for storage of the election materials.  He argued that the involvement of the Deputy Registrar in the exercise was conditional on the materials being stored at the courthouse. The other parties protested that the petitioner was shifting goal posts and abusing the court process. Mr. Marete submitted that the Deputy Registrar had communicated the challenge of space, and had tasked the IEBC to find space. He mentioned that the Deputy Registrar had been tasked to inspect ballot boxes. He then proposed that the matter be mentioned before the Judge for directions. The Deputy Registrar directed that the matter be mentioned before me on a date earlier than 18th October 2017 for directions.      `",
            "\t4. The matter was mentioned before me on 13th October 2017. I heard oral arguments from the parties on their point or points of disagreement so as to assess whether or not there was an issue of interpretation of the orders of 27th September 2017. Prof. Ojienda for the petitioner stated that the said orders fell into two categories. The first category related to the release of the KIEMS Kit, and was comprised in orders 1, 2 and 3 of the consent order; and he submitted that the petitioner had no issue with that. The second category of orders, related to movement of electoral materials from the 1st respondent’s warehouses or stores to the courthouse.  He submitted that the movement of the materials was subject to availability of space at the courthouse. It was submitted that as the materials were to be removed from the custody of the 1st respondent into the custody of the court, it was imperative that the Deputy Registrar be involved to ensure the integrity of the materials from the time they were to leave the 1st respondent’s premises until they were stored in the court’s precincts.  It was stated that as the court had indicated its inability to store the materials, the second tier of the consent order was no longer capable of implementation as framed, as it was no longer tenable to involve the court’s officer in the process. It was submitted that it would violate the provisions of the Elections Act, should the Deputy Registrar be required to handle the election materials when the same were not in the custody of the court.",
            "\t5. Mr. Kibicho for the 1st and 2nd respondents took a mixed position. He conceded that the court had stated that there was no storage space, and that the 1st respondent was happy to avail space for storage of the materials. He did not see anything wrong, however, with the Deputy Registrar preparing a report on the state of the election materials and of the premises where they were stored after the execution of the orders made by the court on 28th August 2017.  He submitted that the execution of the order of 28th August 2017 was done unilaterally, by one side in the absence of the other parties, contrary to the express terms of the order itself for involvement of the other parties. He concluded by stating that the consent order ought to be varied to accord with the changed circumstances.",
            "\t6.  Mr. Marete on behalf of the 3rd respondent submitted that the consent order was made against a certain background, that the petitioner had obtained ex parte orders, which he proceeded to execute ex parte. There was concern that there might have been interference with the integrity of the materials during the process, and the report of the Deputy Registrar was intended to address those concerns. He submitted that the fact that the materials were no longer going to be moved to the courthouse did not preclude the Deputy Registrar’s involvement. He protested that the petitioner was interpreting the order in a manner designed to kill it.",
            "\t7.  Mrs. Rugaita for the 4th respondent submitted that the orders were largely intact, and that the only thing that had changed was the movement of the materials to the courthouse.  She stated that the respondents were still keen on knowing the state and condition of the subject matter of the petition as and when the warehouses or stores are opened for the retrieval of the KIEMS kit. She asserted that if the petitioner had involved the other parties in the execution of the orders made on 28th August 2017 all would have been well with everyone.",
            "\t8. It is common ground that orders 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the consent order of 27th September 2017 relate to movement of electoral materials from the stores of the 1st respondent to those of the court. It is about the 1st respondent surrendering custody of those materials to the court. My reading of the consent order is that as the 1st respondent is to surrender custody of the electoral materials to the court, the officer of the court responsible for administration of court affairs ought to be at hand to receive the materials and place them in proper custody. The officer responsible for and in charge of the day to day administration at a High Court station is the Deputy Registrar. If electoral materials are to be placed in the hands of the court, it should be the duty of the Deputy Registrar to receive them from their current custodian, in this case the 1st respondent.  For every handover there ought to be a status or handover report, addressing the state of the subject matter as at the time it was handed over. Such a status or handover report would be an accounting document. It is critical as questions may arise later touching on the integrity of the subject matter, and the report may shed light as to whether how and when the integrity of the subject matter might have been compromised. It is also now common ground that the court does not have the capacity to store the materials, and therefore it is not in a position to takeover custody relating to them. The circumstances have changed, so that there is no necessity to move the electoral materials to the court for lack of storage.",
            "\t9. The question that arises is whether there is any continued role for the Deputy Registrar in view of the circumstances.  Should he be involved in the movement and storage of the electoral materials, and should he make any report touching on the said movement and storage, and concomitant matters? The answer to these questions are to be found in order 5 of the consent order, the Deputy Registrar’s role is limited by that order to supervising the process of the movement  of the materials to the court precincts and their storage therein. If there is to be movement of the materials for storage purposes to a place other than the court, then the Deputy Registrar would have no business with the said movement and storage. I was invited to give a broader and purposive interpretation to that order. I have carefully read and reread that order; to my mind it is not capable of any other interpretation. A court officer can only be responsible for materials that are within the custody of the court, he should not be tasked with accounting for materials that are in the custody of other persons and entities.",
            "\t10. I agree with the petitioner that the circumstances have changed with regard to storage of the materials at the court premises, and therefore the consent order as it relates to orders 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 can no longer be implemented as currently framed. I agree too with the 1st and 2nd respondents that there is need for variation of the orders so as to bring them into conformity with the changed circumstances. I agree too with the 3rd and 4th respondents that their representatives need to affix their seals on the ballot boxes and assess their state as well as that of the premises where the ballot boxes are currently stored. However, regarding the status report, the Deputy Registrar shall not be available to prepare any, instead each party shall be at liberty to assess the situation and to prepare such report or reports as it pleases, and such party will be at liberty to present such report as evidence at the full trial. The petitioner has already prepared one such report, through the affidavit of Mr. Kamunda, and it was stated from the bar that Mr. Kamunda would be taking the witness stand with regard to that affidavit. The other parties are at liberty to prepare reports along similar lines.",

            "RULING",
            "By a Notice of Appeal filed on 11th March 2005 the Appellants herein lodged an appeal against the decision of the Respondents dated 14th January 2005 by which the Respondents refused to issue the Appellants with an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Licence. The Appellants asked the Tribunal to set aside completely the said decision, to order that an EIA licence for the Appellants’ project do issue forthwith, and to award costs of the Appeal against the Respondents.",
            "In a Memorandum of Appeal lodged with the Notice of Appeal, the Appellants gave the following grounds for the Appeal:",
            "(a)  The Respondents had erred in law by not giving their decision within the mandatory three months after receiving the EIA Study Report;",
            "(b)   The grounds cited by the Respondents for refusing to grant the licence had no basis in law or in fact. The grounds relied on by the Respondents in refusing to grant an EIA licence were that (i) the majority of the local community, lead agencies and stakeholders had expressed strong objection to the project; (ii) the project site lies within the wildlife migratory corridor and dispersal area; (iii) the future cumulative impacts of the project are uncertain given the enormity of the project; (iv) the proposed mitigation measures will not adequately address the anticipated potential environmental impacts of the project; (v) the EIA Study Report did not offer any alternative sites for comparison purposes; and (vi) the project is not environmentally suitable since it will not enhance sustainable development and sound environmental management;",
            "(c)  In arriving at their decision, the Respondents had ignored the mandatory provisions of the law in (i) failing to gazette the EIA Study Report; (ii) failing to properly set up a technical advisory committee on the Appellant’s project; (iii) allowing the 1st Respondent, the Director General of the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA), to participate in and take over the conduct of the proceedings of the public hearing held on 11th December 2004; (iv) holding the public hearing out of time and irregularly; and (v) generally breaching the provisions of the law.",
            "The Respondents entered appearance and filed a Reply to the Memorandum of Appeal on 31st May 2005. The Reply stated that the Respondents intended to raise a preliminary objection to the Appeal on the ground that it was incompetent and to oppose the Appeal. The preliminary objection related to the joinder of the Director General of NEMA as a party to the proceedings, but in a ruling dated 1st July 2005, the Tribunal held that the joinder of the Director General was proper. In opposing the Appeal, the Respondent prayed that the Appeal be dismissed with costs to the Respondents and that the Tribunal should uphold the Respondents’ decision not to issue the EIA licence. ",
            "In support of their opposition to the Appeal the Respondents: (i) denied communicating the decision on the EIA licence application after the mandatory three months; (ii) maintained that they had received strong objections from members of the local community, especially Kitengela Ilparakuo Landowners Association (KILA), from a lead agency, Kenya Wildlife Services KWS, and from a number of stakeholders; (iii) maintained that the site of the proposed project lies within the wildlife migratory corridor and dispersal area; (iv) maintained that they had taken into account the proposed mitigation measures; (v) argued that the project is not environmentally viable notwithstanding that there are other prior developments in the area; (vi) maintained that the location of the project is not suitable in that the free movement of wildlife in the area will be restricted, the culture and heritage of the Maasai will be negatively affected, the riparian ecosystem will be disrupted (vii)  argued that the precautionary principle, the principle of sustainable development and sound environmental management had guided their decision; (viii) argued that it was the Appellants’ responsibility to publish the EIA Study Report in the Gazette and that the Respondents had written to the Appellants to this effect; (ix) argued that the Technical Advisory Committee had been properly constituted; and (x) maintained that the public hearing had been conducted on time and procedurally.",
            "On 19th July, 2005, during the hearing of the Appeal, an application was made verbally by Mr. Naikuni for leave to be given to a number of organizations to intervene in the proceedings as Interested Parties. Both the Appellants and the Respondents had no objection to the application, and the Tribunal took the view that, under section 3 of the Environmental Management and Coordination Act, (EMCA), the parties were entitled to participate in the Appeal. On the basis of these considerations, the application was granted by the Tribunal and the intervenors participated in the Appeal as Interested Parties. At the time when the application to intervene was granted, the Tribunal asked that the registration certificates of these organizations be availed. This was done with respect to some of the organizations, but not others.",

            " The Appeal was heard between 23rd June 2005 and 2nd February 2006. The Tribunal held twenty three (23) sittings, and a total of forty (40) witnesses were called by the Parties. The Appellants called nineteen (19) witnesses, the Respondents called ten (10) witnesses and the Interested Parties called eleven (11) witnesses. The Tribunal visited the site on 2nd August, 2005 in the presence of counsel for both Parties as well as Counsel for the Interested Parties.",
            "On the basis of the positions taken by the Parties, including the Interested Parties, and the evidence adduced before the Tribunal, the following issues arise:",
            "(a)  Whether the majority of the local community, lead agencies and stakeholders had expressed strong objection to the project;",
            "(b)  Whether the proposed project site lies within the wildlife migratory corridor and dispersal area, and if so, whether the location of the project at that site will materially adversely affect the local environment in general and wildlife in particular;",
            "(c)  Whether the mitigation measures proposed in the EIA Study Report are adequate to address the anticipated potential environmental impacts of the project;",
            "(d)  Whether the future cumulative impacts of the project are uncertain and, if so, whether there is in place an adequate framework for handling impacts of the kind that might arise; and",
            "(e)  Whether the Respondents breached legal requirements on the time limit for making a decision on an EIA application, on gazettement, on the establishment of a technical advisory committee, and on the public hearing and, the implication of the breaches, if any, for the validity of the decision of the Respondents.",
            "The Project",
            "The project in question is a proposal to construct 2,000 (two thousand) homes intended to house 2,000 families. Each house is designed for a family of up to five members, bringing the planned total population of the proposed housing estate to 10,000 (ten thousand) people. The houses are to be constructed in phases over a three year period. A population of that kind would be equivalent to that of a small Kenyan town. On the basis of the 1999 census, the population of the proposed settlement is comparable to that of the other towns in Kajiado district: Ngong Township had a population of 12,000 people; Kiserian 16,500; Ongata Rongai 16,200; Isinya 6,000; and Kitengela 12,000. (See the 1999 Population & Housing Census: Counting Our People for Development, Volume 1, 2001).",
            "The families to be housed in the proposed new town are to be drawn from members of a non-governmental organization, called Jamii Bora, which is registered as a Trust under the Trustees (Perpetual Succession) Act, Chapter 164 of the Laws of Kenya",
            "Trust Deed dated 22nd November 1999, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Trust dated 1st December 2000 and the Deed of Appointment of Trustees dated 24th August 2001 were shown to the Tribunal. The Trust Deed states that the purpose of the Trust is “the alleviation and relief of poverty and enhancement of the living conditions of the residents of the Republic of Kenya through the provision of such self-help, credit, savings and other schemes and programmes as the Trustees may think fit…”",
            "The Managing Trustee of Jamii Bora is a Swedish lady by the name Mrs. Ingrid Munro. During her professional career she held various senior positions in several organizations dealing with housing, among them the UN Centre for Human Settlements, currently UN Habitat in Nairobi. Following her retirement, along with a number of poor women from the slums of Nairobi, she founded the Jamii Bora Trust in order to provide these women with a way of improving their lives, and the circumstances of their families. Jamii Bora has grown steadily and now has about 112,000 members drawn from all over the Republic of Kenya. Many of these members reside within the slum areas of Nairobi, in particular Soweto, Kibera and Mathare, where the Trust first began its activities. It was said before the Tribunal that a sizeable number of members reside in Kajiado District.",
            "According to the EIA Study Report, the housing project was conceived with the following objectives:",
            "(a)  To assist poor families from Nairobi’s slums to move out of the slums and achieve their dream of better and secure housing in a good and well managed environment;",
            "(b)  To provide job opportunities and improve income generation for the families moving to the new town as well as for the local residents of Kisaju (the proposed location) by facilitating commercial and industrial development in the town;",
            "(c)  To provide the new and old residents of Kisaju with social and cultural amenities for a better life, such as a modern health centre, schools, sports facilities, playgrounds, churches, a cultural centre and administrative centers; and",
            "(d)  To develop an ecologically sound town with biological cleaning of liquid waste and a green town rich with trees and park areas.",
            "Accordingly, the project is designed as an integrated, self-sustained housing estate. The design provides for low cost housing, with each house expected to cost about Kshs 150,000/-; a small and light industrial zone, a business and commercial centre; educational facilities; infrastructure; an administrative centre; and all the amenities ordinarily associated with a town, including utilities and services, such as water and sewerage services, waste collection and disposal, street lighting, security; recreation and worship. There is provision also for a “Town Management Board.” The developer’s name for the project is “Kaputiei (New) Town.” The development is, of course, not a “town” within the meaning of the Local Government Act, Chapter 265. Nevertheless, its description as a “town” does signify the developer’s intention to develop a functional town. Plainly speaking the project constitutes a private town.",
            "The location for the proposed project is a 293 acre (102.5 hectare) piece of land in Kaputiei, Kisaju Sub-location in Isinya Division of Kajiado District, known as Land Reference number Kajiado/Kisaju/58. This is a piece of private land, which the developer purchased in 2002 from three individuals who then owned it, Ziporah Naisenya, Nathan Kahara and L. Wambaa. A title deed, in the name of Jamii Bora Charitable Trust Registered Trustees, was issued by the Kajiado District Land Registry on 5th February 2002.  The land had originally been agricultural land but, by letter dated 18th January 2002, Ol Kejuado County Council approved a change of its use from agricultural use to business cum residential use. These documents are annexed to the EIA Study Report at pages 189 and 190.",
            "The location of the proposed project lies about 60 km to the south of the city of Nairobi off the main road from Athi River to Kajiado town. The location falls within the ecological zone known as the Athi Kapiti Plains, which is significant for its wildlife. It is bordered to the North by Nairobi National Park and to the South by the Magadi-Mombasa rail line. Historically, the area was occupied predominantly by the Maasai community, who lived a nomadic pastoralist lifestyle. In more recent times, however, the growth of small towns which, functionally, are satellite towns of the city of Nairobi, has changed the demography of the area, leading to a more mixed population and lifestyle.",
            "The Appellants submitted that the proposed project is a novelty in Kenya – representing the first known instance in which a sizeable town has been pre-planned in its entirety “on the drawing board” as it were. An ambitious endeavour of the kind proposed raises a wide range of complex issues for consideration, many of which were the subject of contention before the Tribunal, during the hearing of the project proponent’s Appeal against the denial by the Respondents of the application for an EIA licence.",
            "The Reception to the Proposal",
            "In their letter dated 14th January 2005, refusing to approve the project, the Respondents stated that the majority of the local community, lead agencies and stakeholders had expressed strong objection to the proposed project. In the Reply to the Memorandum of Appeal, filed on 31st May 2005, the Respondents submitted that they did receive strong objections from the local community, especially KILA; from a lead agency, KWS; and from stakeholders, FONNAP, the KIPPRA, Usupuko Environmental Organization, the Wildlife Foundation (Kenya), ILRI, Neighbours Initiative Alliance, Simba Maasai Outreach Organization and Lucas Ole Naikuni.",
            "As evidence of the objection of the local community, the Respondents pointed to letters dated 7th October 2004 and 10th October 2004 from the Secretary and Chairman respectively of KILA, which were produced before the Tribunal marked as DG2 (A) and DG2 (B), and the evidence of Moses Kipiro, Alex Pushati, Regan Ole Makui, Jackson Nasuka, Solomon Meki, Mary Kipurket, Samson Ole Timoi, and Councillor Julius Ole Ntayia.",
            "The witnesses testified that initially they were happy about the project when they were told that it would bring services and create jobs in the local area. But when they learnt that the project would introduce into the area people from the slums of Nairobi they became opposed to it. In their view, people from the slums of Nairobi had social and cultural attributes that were different from those of the local Maasai, and this would adversely affect the local culture and lifestyle, the local political equation, the local security and the local environment. These arguments were strongly supported by the witnesses of the Interested Parties.",
            "The Interested Parties argued that this project was not a project for the Maasai people. Witnesses said in evidence that “housing is not a priority for the Maasai people.” They also argued that the project would interfere with the socio-cultural lifestyles of the locality, by introducing an influx of people of different cultures and backgrounds who would bring to the area drug abuse, rape, prostitution and other social ills, given, particularly, that some of the members of the Jamii Bora Trust, who intended to take up the houses, had, in the past, been criminals and prostitutes. The Interested Parties saw in the project a serious threat to continued survival of the Maasai community. ",
            " The Appellants strongly disputed the claim that the majority of the local community, lead agencies and stakeholders had expressed strong objection to the project. They asserted that, to the contrary, the majority of the genuine local community members and the majority of genuine and real stakeholders had expressed strong support for the project. They also contended that several lead agencies had given their approval to the project.",
            "The Appellants’ view is that the term “local community” means residents of Kisaju sub-location. It was on this premise that they challenged the evidence of the people opposed to the project. They argued that these were not genuine local community members: they were either representatives of professional non-governmental organizations or persons who did not own property within the Kisaju sub-location, and whose association with the sub-location was tenuous. Only a very small number of people actually resident in the area had come forth to give evidence against the project, the Appellants argued.",
            "According to the Appellants, the majority of genuine residents of Kisaju sub-location supported the project. The Appellants produced in evidence a Memorandum of Understanding, signed between the Appellants and the local residents of Kisaju sub-location, represented by their area Councillor on 17th August 2004 by which the developer promised to provide services and facilities like water, schools, employment and other benefits to the residents of Kisaju sub-location living outside the proposed housing estate. They also produced a petition in support of the project signed or thumb printed by nearly all the 500 land owners in Kisaju sub-location. The registration numbers of their parcels of land are shown alongside their signatures or, in some instances, thumb prints. They also produced letters written in support of the project by the local church leaders. These documents are annexed to pages 291 to 344 of the EIA Study Report. Several residents of Kisaju sub-location also testified before the Tribunal in support of project.",
            "The Tribunal takes the view that, from an environmental perspective, the term “local community” cannot be restricted to residents of Kisaju sub-location. Given the key environmental concerns raised, the project’s implications for the continued use of the Athi-Kapiti Plains (also known as the Kitengela Conservation Area) as a wildlife habitat, of which Kisaju sub-location is only a small sub-set, properly speaking, the project’s locality is the whole of the ecosystem known as Athi Kapiti Plains. This is the area bounded by Mombasa Railway from Athi River to Konza to the east, former Enkarau-Ilman group ranches bordering Konza-Kajiado railway to the south, former Kipeto group ranch bordering Isinya Kiserian road to the west and Nairobi National Park to the North. Towns within this area include Athi River, Kitengela, Isinya, Kiserian and Ongata Rongai and Ngong. This whole area comprises the project’s local area, and it formed the area of study for the EIA Study as shown by the map attached to the EIA Study Report.",
            "None of the parties presented evidence of the views of the residents of this bigger area, because, obviously, they understood the term “local community” differently from the definition of “local area” from an environmental stand point. The evidence before the Tribunal shows that opinion within Kisaju sub-location is divided. There are those in support of the project and those in opposition. Both views are strongly held, and both were vigorously put forth before the Tribunal. As people who will primarily be affected by the project, their views are relevant.",
            "Those views were founded on concerns related to the risk of environmental degradation, and of adverse social and cultural impacts. Several examples were given of these risks. They included the risk of pollution of local watercourses; environmental degradation from uncontrolled disposal of solid waste, such as plastic bags, which would present a hazard to cattle and wildlife; a rise in crime; an increase in human-wildlife conflict; urban sprawl; and a disruption of the social cohesion in the area. Of particular concern was the fact that the members of Jamii Bora were not from the local area. The Tribunal has considered all of these issues in its ruling.",
            "The weight to be given to the views of members of the local community on a proposed project, however, is, in the Tribunal’s view, dependent on the pertinence of the environmental issues upon which these views are based. Views which are not founded on pertinent environmental concerns posed by the proposed project, however strongly held, should not be allowed to influence the outcome of an EIA licence application. ",
            "In the Tribunal’s view the Respondents were not justified to give the weight which they appeared to have given in their decision to the views of those members of Kisaju sub-location who are opposed to the project. The Respondents did not make any effort to ascertain whether the views of those who expressed objection were representative of the views of a significant section of the local community. But crucially, the objections of the local community upon which the Respondents relied to deny the Appellants the EIA licence appeared to be unduly influenced by an objection to “outsiders” from the slums of Nairobi settling in the local area and, in their view, changing the demographic equation. By the same token, the local community members who support the project do so principally because it promises to introduce into the area social services and economic opportunities which they have longed for over many decades. These considerations, though understandable, are not environmental considerations, and should not be allowed to determine the outcome of an EIA licence application. In any case, the 1999 census shows that the population of Kajiado district is already mixed, and the Maasai constitute not more than 57% of the residents.",
            "As evidence of the objection of the lead agencies, the Respondents pointed to the strong objections lodged by KWS which had written a letter dated 7th October 2004 to the effect that “KWS does not support the project as it has no conservation merit and is within the wildlife dispersal area and the traditional wildlife migration route to and from Nairobi National Park.” The witnesses representing KWS also testified to KWS’s opposition to the project.",
            "The Appellants, on the other hand, pointed out that several lead agencies had given their approval to the project. The Ministry of Roads and Public Works, had written a letter dated 17th September 2004 and 11th November 2004 giving its approval to the road works that are part of the proposed project; by letter dated 11th October 2002, the Director of Water Development approved an application to drill a borehole for domestic water supply as part of the project; Kenya Power and Lighting Company Ltd approved the developer’s application for a power supply by letter dated 17th September 2004; the Physical Planning Department gave approval to the project by letter dated 24th September 2004; Olkejuado County Council approval as evidenced by notification of approval dated 22nd June 2004. These documents are annexed to the EIA Study Report at pages 191, 236, and 238 to 248.",
            "Under section 60 of the Environmental Management and Coordination Act, 1999 (EMCA) and Regulation 20 of the Environmental (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations 2003, NEMA is required to take into account the views of lead agencies with regard to an EIA Study Report, which therefore are relevant considerations. Whereas KWS gave comments directly in response to the EIA Study Report, the support for the project upon which the Appellants relied arose out of applications by the Appellants for approvals which it is the mandate of the various lead agencies to grant. Apart from KWS and the Kajiado District Physical Planning Liaison Committee, the other lead agencies were not dealing with the EIA Study Report.",
            "Clearly, a project whose key aspects have failed to obtain the approval of the regulatory agencies concerned is at risk of not getting off the ground. Therefore, the approvals granted by lead agencies to various aspects of a proposed project are relevant in considering the viability of the proposed project. In this respect, approvals for the construction of a road, for power supply, for drilling boreholes, for change of use are all relevant considerations in determining the likely viability of this project. What the Act and the Regulations call for from the lead agencies, however, are comments on the environmental issues within their mandate arising from the EIA Study Report. Apart from KWS, the lead agencies cited here did not expressly address these issues.",
            "The objection of KWS relates primarily to the location of the proposed project. In a letter dated 15th February 2005 to the 1st Respondent and annexed to the Respondents’ bundle of documents referred to as DG3(B) KWS stated as follows:",
            "“(1) KWS is not against the proposed project. We do not approve of the location. (2) It is our strong recommendation that Jamii Bora be advised to relocate the project to suitable sites preferably Kibera or Mathare. (3) We would appreciate if the current project site is managed in a manner compatible to conservation.”",
            "As part of its consideration of the issue relating to the location of the proposed project, the Tribunal considers the weight to be given to the views expressed by KWS on the location of the proposed project.",
            "The Respondents also cited objections from several stakeholders as a reason for denying the Appellants an EIA licence. FONNAP, KILA, the KIPRRA, Usupuko Environmental Organization, the Wildlife Foundation (Kenya), ILRI, Neighbours Initiative Alliance, and Simba Maasai Outreach Organization were cited as stakeholders who had objected to the project.",
            "Marie Louise Poulley, a member of the KIPRRA, Simon Ole Timoi, a member of Duputo e Maa, and David Nkedienye, previously a member of the Wildlife Foundation, all testified against the proposed project. Additionally, the Respondents produced as part of their bundle of documents and marked DG5, a “Memorandum,” which was an email bearing the names of these same organizations, and that of Lucas ole Naikuni, which had been sent on 12 December 2004 to NEMA, the Stromme Foundation (a Norwegian Organization providing funding support to the Jamii Bora Trust) and the Nation Media Group.  The thrust of the objection by these stakeholders to the proposed project was that, while its objectives were noble, its location was inappropriate, and it should be relocated, preferably to the slum areas of Nairobi. ",
            "The Appellants disputed the claim by these witnesses to represent the organizations they claimed to represent: none of them had produced any Resolution or other authorization to speak on behalf of these organizations and, according to the Appellants, it was clear that they were speaking only for themselves. Additionally, the Appellants challenged the validity of the “stake” these witnesses claimed to have in this project: Marie Louise Poulley was simply motivated by the desire to protect her hotel business, which thrived on the area’s perceived isolation; Simon Ole Timoi lived all the way near the Tanzanian border, and his claim that, as a Maasai, he had an interest in the welfare of Maasais wherever they lived lacked credence; and David Nkedienye was no longer a member of the Wildlife Foundation and could not represent it.",
            "For its part, the Appellants relied on the support for the project by the Architectural Association of Kenya represented by Mohamed Munyanya, the Chairman and the Association of Micro Finance Institutions (AMFI) represented by Beatrice Sabana, the Chief Executive. Mr. Munyanya testified that it is the view of the Architectural Association that this project represents a model of affordable housing in Kenya which should be supported by the authorities and emulated by others, particularly in light of the Government’s policy of providing affordable housing to Kenyans. Beatrice Sabana testified that Jamii Bora is known and respected within the micro-finance fraternity. She argued that Jamii Bora’s initiative in providing housing to its members through micro-finance arrangements deserves support, since poor people, with no collateral, are not able to access financing through banks, and of necessity, depend on micro-finance arrangements to meet their investment needs.",
            "The opinions of stakeholders with regard to the potential environmental impacts of a proposed project is a relevant consideration, which is provided for in section 59(2) of EMCA and Regulation 21 of the EIA Regulations. With respect to this project, opinion was divided between, on the one hand, those who would give primacy to the concerns related to the potential adverse impact of this project on the wildlife in the area and, on the other, those who consider that the pressing need for decent housing by the residents of the slum areas, which this project is designed to contribute to solving, is equally deserving.",
            "In the Tribunal’s view, the role of the EIA process in this instance is to provide ways of balancing both concerns, in order to meet the need of the poor slum dwellers for decent housing without causing an undue adverse impact on the environment of the locality in which the proposed housing project is to be located. The Tribunal considers that the decision by the Respondents fell short of adequately balancing both concerns, and that the Respondents were not justified in preferring the views of those stakeholders who objected to the project without considering whether the objectives of the project, which all the objectors said were worthwhile, could be met in the absence of this project.",
            "The Location of the Project",
            "The second ground cited by the Respondents for denying the Appellants the EIA licence is that project site lies within the wildlife migratory corridor and dispersal area, and that the project will adversely affect the continued use of the area as a wildlife habitat. The witnesses who testified on behalf of the Respondents on this issue were Mr. Paul Gathitu, the Nairobi National Park Senior Warden between 2000 and 2004; Gideon Amboga, the current Senior Warden; Dr Samuel Kasike, an Ecologist; Mrs. Elizabeth Leitoro, the Community Development Officer; and Ms Teresia Muthui, from the KWS GIS section. Documentary evidence was also produced in a bundle marked “Additional Documents Submitted by NEMA.” Among them is an undated draft document titled “Nairobi National Park Ecosystem Management Plan, 2005-2010” – Kenya Wildlife Service [hereinafter The Draft NNP Management Plan], which encapsulates the key points of the Respondents’ evidence on this issue.",
            "The Respondents evidence was to the effect that the project site lies within an ecological zone known as the Athi Kapiti Plains (also described as the Kitengela Conservation Area, or the Kitengela Triangle), which is in Kajiado District. Its size has been estimated variously as ranging between 390 km2 and 450 km2. Much of this area acts as a habitat for wildlife. The Nairobi National Park, founded in 1948, and covering 117 km2 constitutes the centerpiece of the Athi-Kapiti ecosystem. The Park is home to over 100 mammal species and is an internationally acclaimed tourist attraction. The wildlife found in the Nairobi National Park disperse freely in the Athi-Kapiti Plains ecosystem. Two animals in particular, the zebra and the wildebeest, migrate seasonally to a calving zone located in the southern extremity of the Athi Kapiti Plains, specifically Kaputei North, which, on Figure 1 appearing at page 9 of The Draft NNP Management Plan, is shown to be adjacent to Kisaju sub-location, the project area.",
            "At page 35 of The Draft NNP Management Plan it is stated that distribution and movements of wildebeest and zebra in the Nairobi National Park ecosystem are influenced by instinct, availability of food resources, breeding and the rainfall patterns. During the wet season, the animals use the Kitengela Triangle and the southern portion of the plains in North Kaputei. However, as the rainfall drops, wildebeest concentrate more and more to the northwest, in or immediately south of Nairobi National Park. Zebras seldom concentrate as much as wildebeest; instead they are broadly distributed. The wildebeest spend the rainy season calving in the southern section of the Athi Kapiti Plains, in the former North Kaputei group ranch, where the grass growth is productive and the nutrient contents are high.",
            "The young wildebeest in their first year of life get a “guided tour” of the ecosystem to and from Nairobi National Park. This experience ensures that the knowledge of the migratory routes are imprinted on them and passed on from generation to generation. The Respondents gave evidence that in 2004 and again in 2005 KWS plotted this migration route using information gathered by the aid of geographic information systems technology (GIS) as well from members of the local community. Teresia Muthui used this information to plot a 2 km wide migratory route on two maps – which we shall refer to as the June 2004 Map and the June 2005 Map. According to the Respondents these maps show that the proposed Jamii Bora project lies within the wildlife migration corridor and dispersal area.",
            "At pages 19 to 24 of The Draft NNP Management Plan it is noted that a general decline in wildlife numbers in the ecosystem has been observed over the past decade. The document attributes the decline in wildlife population to:",
            "(a)  Land use change in some areas of the Kitengela area from semi-nomadic pastoralism to industrial/commercial uses like flower farming, quarrying, and small settlements;",
            "(b)  Increase in human population and rising poverty levels in the Athi-Kapiti Ecosystem;",
            "(c)  Increase in land sales and sub-division of group ranches into private parcels;",
            "(d)  Increase in small fences along the traditional zebra and wildebeest migratory routes;",
            "(e)  Subsistence and commercial poaching occasioned by pilot cropping programme within the ecosystem;",
            "(f)  Occurrence of droughts, the latest one in the year 2000;",
            "(g)  Disease outbreak, e.g rinderpest, which in 1996/97 reduced the buffalo population  by almost half; and",
            "(h)  Habitat change. ",
            "With regard to the increased human settlement in the wildlife dispersal area, the document elaborates that “human settlement along the Mbagathi River near Rongai and the development of the export processing zone next to Kitengela town has resulted in an increase in human population within the Kitengela settlement areas. The high population growth rate experienced in this area has been attributed to the emigration of people from neighbouring Machakos district and Nairobi city. The human population in the Kitengela area has more than doubled between 1989 and 1999.”",
            "With regard to land sub-division and fragmentation it is said that: “Sub-division of land within the Kajiado area begun in 1984 following a shift in Government policy on group ranches that encouraged sub-division. The number of group ranches that had sub-divided rose from 7 in 1984 to 12 in 1990 to 22 in 1996 … Proximity to Nairobi city has accelerated land sales and fragmentation. The area is very attractive to those seeking residential plots, e.g the case of former Kitengela, Kisaju, and Embolioi ranches.” With increased land fragmentation through fencing and residential use in the Kitengela area in the last ten years, migratory routes are progressively being altered, although the migration/dispersal areas are still largely open and unfenced. According to evidence produced before the Tribunal, about 10% of the dispersal area in the Athi- Kapiti Plains has been blocked by fencing and other developments.",
            "The Draft NNP Management Plan observes that the maintenance of the Park’s ecological integrity depends on wildlife access to the Kitengela-Athi Kapiti migration/dispersal area. The Park cannot support the variety and numbers of wildlife normally seen within it. The Park ecosystem can only be viable if the traditional wildlife migration routes are maintained. However there has been recent rapid land adjudication and sub-divisions and increased settlements without a coherent land-use plan, which has reduced the wildlife dispersal area. ",
            "The Draft NNP Management Plan sets out the objectives of Kenya Wildlife Service with regard to the long term future of Nairobi National Park to be “to ensure that the rich biodiversity resources are managed in an environmentally sound and sustainable manner while at the same time contributing to the economic development of the communities living adjacent to the Park and the entire Kenyan nation.” Towards this end, the wildlife migration and dispersal areas will be managed by:",
            "(a)  Collaborating with landowners and other conservation stakeholders in management of wildlife outside the park;",
            "(b)  Ensuring that the Kitengela wildlife migration/dispersal area is accessible to wildlife through the maintenance and expansion of the Wildlife Conservation Lease Programme;",
            "(c)  Encouraging and assisting communities living adjacent to the Park to benefit from wildlife based activities on their land; and",
            "(d)  Minimizing human-wildlife conflicts outside the Park.",
            "The Draft NNP Management Plan outlines the intervention measures which KWS proposes to take over the Plan period to achieve its management objectives:",
            "(a)  The southern section of the Park adjoins the former “Sheep and Goats” Ranch, which is a critical diurnal dispersal area as it is not settled and is free from fences. This section therefore needs to be left open for free movement of wildlife to and from the Park and the rest of the migration/dispersal lands beyond. KWS will pursue a conservation easement with the Ministry of Lands and where possible acquire the land. The 1.5 km2  parcel adjacent to the Park is legally under the Commissioner of Lands.",
            "(b)  The dispersal area should be managed as one unit with these migrants. If they are fenced out, they are likely to be fenced to extinction.",
            "(c)  The migration and dispersal areas are still fairly open and land fragmentation, which is the main threat to the viability of the dispersal areas, is accelerating. However, this can be forestalled. Where we cannot form conservancies or acquire the land in the dispersal areas, we will use the existing legal instruments to stop fragmentation.",
            "(d)  The Wildlife Conservation Lease Programme will be expanded as a short term stop gap measure to secure the dispersal area.",
            "(e)  Acquisition of land for conservation.",
            "These measures can be summarized as follows: the acquisition of an easement over the Government owned former Sheep and Goat Ranch; collaboration with landowners to keep open the migratory routes and dispersal areas, through programmes such as Wildlife Conservation Lease Programme, enforcement of existing land use and management laws; and, where necessary, compulsory acquisition of private land.",
            " Evidence was given by Elizabeth Leitoro, the KWS Community Development Officer of programmes undertaken by KWS designed to enhance community wildlife conservation in the Kitengela area, including plans to establish community conservancies, as well as schemes for the sharing of benefits arising from wildlife derived revenue with the local community, such as the construction by KWS of facilities, such as schools and boreholes for the use of the local community.",
            "The Respondents gave evidence that KWS collaborates with a non-governmental organization, the Wildlife Foundation, which administers a “Lease Programme,” whose objective is to keep the area open for wildlife habitation by paying land owners a “lease fee” in exchange for an agreement by the landowners not to sub-divide, fence or farm the land. Detailed evidence regarding the Lease Programme was adduced by Regan Ole Makui, a Director of the Wildlife Foundation and David Nkedienye, formerly a Director of the Wildlife Foundation. The evidence showed that KWS does not itself run the programme, although the offices of the Wildlife Foundation are located within the KWS premises, and KWS supports its objectives.",
            "The Lease Programme started in 2000 with funding support from Friends of Nairobi National Park and the Wildlife Trust, which is registered in the USA. Landowners apply to be registered on the Programme, and once funding is obtained the landowners are paid US$4 per acre per annum, averaging to an annual payment of US$400 to US$800 per household. The area under the Programme stands at 8,600 acres involving 117 households. In order to achieve its objective of keeping the migratory route and dispersal area, the Programme’s coverage needs to be expanded to cover the minimum area of 30 km2  (60,000 acres). The Wildlife Foundation is fundraising from among others, the Global Environment Facility, to be able to establish an endowment fund to support the Programme. According to the Respondents the Programme works well, a contention with which the Appellants strongly disagreed. (See paragraphs 63 and 64 below).",
            "The Respondents argued that, because the project site lies within the migratory corridor and dispersal area, the proposed housing project will block the wildlife migratory route and threaten the continued use of the area by wildlife as a dispersal area, for which the area should conserved. The Respondents acknowledged the ongoing sub-divisions and change of use but argued that these were being addressed through a “Master Zoning Plan”, which Ol Kejuado County Council was in the process of preparing. Evidence was given by Mr. Patrick Waweru, the Kajiado District Physical Planner, who stated that a land use plan titled “Kitengela-Isinya Zoning Plan” was currently in draft at the Council. The essence of this plan was to zone development areas and non-development areas. Kisaju sub-location, according to Mr. Waweru, was classified as a wildlife and pastoralism promotion zone.",
            "The Interested Parties supported the position taken by the Respondents with regard to the location of the proposed project. Alongside KWS the Interested Parties argued that to introduce this project into the area would jeopardize the use of the area as a habitat for wildlife, threaten the continued viability of Nairobi National Park, increase human-wildlife conflict, increase the risk of poaching and undermine the Lease Programme. The Interested Parties therefore argued that the refusal of the EIA licence application was justified and should be upheld by the Tribunal. ",
            "The Appellants vigorously contested the Respondents’ proposition that this project will have a material adverse effect on the migration and dispersal of wildlife in the Athi Kapiti ecosystem. The Appellants maintained that the evidence available showed that the project site lies outside of the wildlife migratory corridor. In so far as the dispersal area is concerned, the Appellants argued that, given the dramatic changes in land use that are already occurring in the Athi Kapiti ecosystem area, this particular project will not, on its own, materially adversely affect the status of wildlife in the area in ways that cannot be managed through the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures.",
            "The Appellants’ case was that they had relied on a map titled “Nairobi National Park and Proposed 2 km Buffer Along Kitengela Migratory Route” and dated June 2004, the June 2004 Map, which was given to the Appellants by KWS itself during the time they were carrying the EIA Study. This map is attached to the EIA Study Report at pages 155 and 355. On this map the Jamii Bora project is shown as being 4 km or so away from the wildlife migratory corridor. Subsequently, after the Appellants had filed this Appeal, and during the hearing, the Respondents applied to be allowed to introduce a map titled “Nairobi National Park Ecosystem Wildlife Distribution – June 2005 (Draft) – the June 2005 Map.  This second map incorporates a wider area within the dispersal area, including not only the Jamii Bora project, but also other towns like Kitengela and the developments around it. According to the Appellants, the June 2005 Map was misleading and had been generated for no reason other than to shore up the Respondents argument that the project lies within the dispersal area, a proposition with which the Respondents strongly disagreed. ",
            "The evidence before the Tribunal showed that information upon which the maps were generated had been gathered at the request of Dr Robert Ndetei, an officer with KWS, and that it was gathered by field scouts from KWS with input from local community members. That much is confirmed by the maps themselves, which state the source of information to be, in the case of the June 2004 Map, SoK, KWS and the Wildlife Foundation, and in the case of the June 2005 Map, the Nairobi National Park Field Staff and Kitengela Community Representatives. In cross examination, it was admitted by Teresia Muthui who plotted the information on the maps, that the “community representatives” in question was, in reality, Benson Mutunkei, the Wildlife Foundation officer in charge of the Lease Programme. The Appellants argued that the information provided by Benson Mutunkei with regard to the existence and location of the migratory corridor and dispersal area, could not be relied on as the Wildlife Foundation was vehemently opposed to the Jamii Bora Project, and therefore had a vested interest in showing that its location lay within the migratory corridor and dispersal area.",
            "The Appellants argued also that, with regard to the use of the area as a wildlife dispersal area, the numbers of wildlife had declined drastically. They pointed to KWS’s evidence on this issue. Relying on a map titled “Animal Census: Kitengela Area – November 2002” which had been put in evidence by the Respondents, the Appellants argued that, during the 2002 census the animals which had been monitored, that is, wildebeest, impala, kongoni, Grant’s gazelle, zebra, Thompson’s gazelle, and ostrich, were not spotted in the Kisaju sub-location. The Appellants therefore maintained that, on the basis of the evidence available to them at the time of the EIA Study, the animal numbers in the entire dispersal area were small at best, and therefore they were entitled to conclude that the proposed project would not have a significant adverse effect on the use of the area as a wildlife migratory corridor and dispersal area. The Respondents had produced no evidence to justify any other conclusion.",
            "Further the Appellants argued that, in any case, due to the massive uncontrolled sub-divisions and consequent rapid change of land use in the area from pastoralism to industrial, commercial and residential use, the use of the Athi Kapiti Plains as a wildlife migratory corridor and dispersal area was no longer viable.  The Appellants called in evidence a surveyor, Mr. Joseph Mugo who testified that up to nearly 50,000 sub-divisions had already taken place in the Athi-Kapiti ecosystem area. This evidence was corroborated by the evidence of James Kamula of the East African Wildlife Society who submitted in evidence a document titled “A Survey to Determine the Availability of Land for Wildlife Migration in the Areas Bordering Nairobi National Park,” which contained the results of a study carried out by East African Wildlife Society. At page 10 of this document there is a table showing the number of landowners in the former seven group ranches in the Athi Kapiti Plains which shows that, based on the information in the Kajiado District land adjudication department, as at March 2004, the registered landowners in the ecosystem stood at 42,305.",
            "The Appellants saw no prospects of this trend being reversed. The sub-divisions and change of use are taking place in a policy vacuum of land use since neither the Government nor the local authority has a land use plan. The draft Master Zoning Plan, which Mr. Waweru had claimed was under preparation by Ol Kejuado County Council, had not yet been sent out for public consultation, as required by the Physical Planning Act, Chapter 286, and therefore, there was no telling whether the landowners in the area would accept it. Consequently, the proposal to designate Kisaju area as a wildlife and pastoralism promotion area might never be adopted for implementation. It could not therefore be the basis of decision making at this stage.",
            "The Appellants were highly skeptical of the Lease Programme, upon which KWS placed faith as the key plank of its community conservation programme. The Appellants challenged the validity of the leases that were produced in evidence. On the basis of evidence obtained from the Kajiado District Land Registry, the Appellants demonstrated that many of the parcels of land said to be under the Lease Programme have ceased to exist as single units following the sub-division of the land parcels which occurred either for purposes of sale of the land to third parties or upon the death of a title holder and inheritance of the land by dependents. With respect to Kisaju sub-location, almost all the land parcels listed as being on the Lease Programme had in fact been sub-divided. Given that the main objective of the Lease Programme was to save the lands from being sub-divided, the Lease Progarmme, in the Appellants view, was not viable.",
            "The Appellants argued also that, on the basis of the evidence produced by the Respondents, 60,000 acres needed to be brought into the Lease Programme in order for this Programme to be able to secure the Athi Kapiti area migratory route and dispersal area. Presently, only 8,600 acres, had been registered under the Programme. Few large parcels remain intact and, given the far higher financial gains which landowners can obtain from sub-dividing and selling their land for residential and other purposes, few will be willing to take on the commitments of the Lease Programme.  Therefore, the Appellants argued, this Programme had no realistic prospects of realizing its objectives in the foreseeable future.",
            "The evidence before the Tribunal, including the site visit by the members of the Tribunal to the project site on 2nd August 2005, indicates that the Athi Kapiti Plains does serve as a wildlife habitat and a dispersal area for Nairobi National Park. Taking all factors into account, and having listened to the witnesses who testified on this issue, the Tribunal is inclined to believe that the migratory corridor lies more or less where the June 2004 Map placed it, approximately 4 km away from the project site, while the dispersal area covers a much wider area, including the project site. The Tribunal notes, additionally, that, despite the name “corridor”, the wildlife migratory corridor and dispersal area is not to be understood as being a fixed line, in the sense of a road, given the nature of wildlife movements. ",
            "Neither party gave comprehensive evidence on the exact nature of impact on wildlife in the area, adverse or positive, that might arise from the location of the project at the proposed site. The evidence that was tendered was premised on the assumption that, if it could be demonstrated that the project site lies within the migratory corridor and dispersal zone, the inevitable conclusion must be that the impact of the project on the wildlife in the area would be adverse. Whereas claims were made about the risk of poaching, no credible evidence was adduced to demonstrate why this incoming population would be more prone to poach wildlife than anyone else residing in the vicinity. Claims were made also to the fact that the migratory route would be blocked by the new settlement, but it was not demonstrated convincingly that there would be any less risk of blockage arising from the unplanned settlements and conversion of the area from pastoralism to commercial farming, industrial and residential use that is going on in the area. Equally, neither party gave evidence to demonstrate that wildlife is capable or incapable of adjusting to the new developments..",
            "The Tribunal does not accept that a development on a 293 acre plot, within an ecosystem of between 390 to 450 km2, on its own, will spell the end of the ecosystem as a wildlife habitat. This is more so in light of the fact that there are already, within the same ecosystem, 6 other towns of a comparable, or even larger, population sizes. Further, unlike the proposed New (Kaputiei) Town, the other towns and settlements were not planned in advance and lack basic amenities such as sewerage systems, waste disposal arrangements and other facilities which are essential components of an urban settlement. In the Tribunal’s view the proposed new development offers an opportunity to find ways of meeting the pressing demand for decent housing by residents of Nairobi and other nearby towns within a framework that provides systems for mitigating the potential adverse environmental impacts arising from human settlement within this ecosystem. It is much to be preferred to spontaneous unplanned settlements, which are going on unchecked within the ecosystem. ",
            "This conclusion is borne out by the High Court’s decision in the case of Peter K. Waweru v The Republic, Nairobi Misc. Civil Application No 118 of 2004, delivered on 2nd March 2006, shortly after the Tribunal concluded hearings on the instant Appeal. Those who believe that, if the proposed Jamii Bora housing project is not implemented, then the Athi Kapiti plains will remain, as they see it, a pristine ecosystem, unspoilt by the impacts of urbanization, will find a reading of this High Court decision an eye opener.",
            "The case arose out of a prosecution for the offences of discharging raw sewage into a public water source contrary to the Public Health Act, Chapter 282, and of failing to comply with a statutory notice to remove a nuisance. The alleged offenders were about 100 plot owners in Kiserian Township who have erected residential and commercial buildings on the plots. The buildings have septic tank for the disposal of wastewater to which the plot owners have connected underground pipes to act as overflow outlets. This causes the indiscriminate discharge of offensive smelling waste matters within the trading center, which flows out of various premises into open channels along the road to the Kiserian river, a source of drinking water. In answer to the charges, the plot owners pleaded that they are helpless without a sewage treatment plant, that the responsibility to construct one lies on the Ol Kejaudo county council and that, in any case, the area earmarked for the plant has been acquired for private use. In the words of the court, Kiserian township is:",
            "“a ticking time bomb waiting to explode... We are also concerned that the situation described to us could be the position in many other towns in Kenya especially as regards uncoordinated approval of development and the absence of sewerage treatment works.”",
            "The Tribunal is mindful of the real risk that, if decisive action is not taken in the near future, the Athi Kapiti Plains will not continue to function for long as a wildlife habitat and dispersal area for the Nairobi National Park. However, the Tribunal believes that the threat to the viability of the wildlife habitat arises, not from any one development, spontaneous or planned, but from the absence of an enforceable land use plan for the area, which has then allowed uncoordinated and unplanned sub-divisions and conversions of land use - from pastoralism to commercial, industrial and residential uses - to take place on individual plots without being accompanied by the development of the necessary common infrastructural and utility services.",
            "The concept of a Zoning Master Plan which is being considered by the Ol Kejuado County Council is to be encouraged. If fully developed and implemented it will provide a framework for considering the future of the Athi Kapiti Plains in its entirety, in a way that will not unduly prejudice any one land owner. Clearly, developing such a Master Plan takes time, and some might argue that it is not proper to allow developments which cannot later be reversed to proceed in the meantime simply because a land use plan has not yet been developed. On the basis of this argument, it might be considered that an applicant for an EIA licence should not be granted the licence because, if and when the land use plan is adopted, the damage would have been done, and the development cannot be reversed.",
            "The Physical Planning Act, Chapter 286, under which the proposed Zoning Master Plan would be adopted caters for a situation in which it is considered that developments should be halted pending the preparation and adoption of a physical plan as a basis for development control:",
            "“Section 23(1) provides that the Director may, by notice in the Gazette, declare an area with unique development potential or problems as a special planning area for the purpose of the preparation of a physical development plan irrespective of whether such an area lies within or outside the area of a local authority. Section 23(2) states that the Director may, by notice in the Gazette, suspend for a period of not more than two years, any development he deems necessary in a special planning area until the physical development plan in respect of such an area has been approved by the Minister.” (Italics inserted).  ",
            "Therefore, there is a legal framework available to the Ol Kejuado County Council which would enable it, if it so chooses, to suspend development in the Athi Kapiti Plains while a land use (or physical development) plan is being prepared. Neither the Council nor the Ministry in charge of land use planning has taken any steps to make use of this provision with respect to this area. In the absence of an official and gazetted suspension of development within the Athi Kapiti Plains ecosystem, or of a gazetted land use plan, each application must be considered on its own merits and demerits, and not on the general principle – whether or not meritorious - that developments within this particular area should be curtailed. Accordingly, a denial of an application for an EIA licence, without a clear demonstration that the proposed project poses a risk of causing potentially adverse environmental impacts that cannot be mitigated, would not be justifiable.",
            "In coming to that conclusion, the Tribunal has taken into account the submissions of the Respondents to the effect that the fact that developments have taken place in the Athi Kapiti Plains wrongfully in the past is not a justification for allowing another wrongful development to take place: “two wrongs do not make a right,” the Tribunal was told. Clearly they do not. In the Tribunal’s respectful view, however, it is not wrong for a landowner to develop his land. What would be unlawful, would be for a landowner to develop his land without obtaining the required permissions and licences. The application for the licence must be considered in terms of the legislation that imposes the licence requirement. If those requirements are met, the development ought to be allowed to proceed, in which case, the development would not be wrongful.",
            "On the basis of its consideration of the evidence that was adduced before it, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondents’ were not justified to deny the Appellants an EIA licence on the ground that the project site lies within the wildlife migratory route and dispersal area, without demonstrating why the potential adverse impacts to which KWS had pointed, such as the risk of poaching and the potential blockage of the migratory corridor, could not be mitigated.",
            "Whereas the Tribunal has concluded that the Respondents did not sufficiently justify their denial of the EIA licence application under this head, the Tribunal is not satisfied with the adequacy of the information that was provided by the Parties on one aspect of this issue. That the general Athi Kapiti area serves as a migratory corridor and dispersal area for Nairobi National Park is clear. What is less clear is whether, and if so, how the proposed project, in particular, will affect the future viability of the area as a migratory corridor and dispersal area. If it will, the possible mitigation measures were not fully elaborated on by the Parties. The Tribunal is of the view that information provided by the Parties on this point was insufficient.",
            "Under section 62 of EMCA, NEMA may require a project proponent to carry out further evaluation or environmental impact assessment study and submit additional information for the purpose of ensuring that the EIA Study Report is as accurate and exhaustive as possible. The Respondents did not make use of this provision to ask for further information from the applicant before denying the licence application. The Tribunal believes that further information on this particular point would assist in identifying the nature of mitigatory measures that might be required to minimize potential adverse impacts of this project on the ecosystem, if any.",
            "In its letter dated 7th October 2004 to the Director General of NEMA submitting comments to the EIA Study Report, KWS identified mitigation measures which might be adopted to minimize potentially adverse impacts of the project. These include putting up a surveillance outpost manned by KWS and tagging some animals (in particular wildebeest and zebra) to ascertain the extent of the wildlife migratory corridor and dispersal area and to monitor the route to and from the Park. Both of these measures underscore the need for more information as a basis for decision making and action.",
            "The Tribunal believes that these additional mitigation measures should be costed and adopted as an integral component of the Project, and catered for in the project budget since they would provide mechanisms for filling the information gap that has been identified. As more information is systematically gathered and scientifically analysed, the mitigatory measures proposed can be refined so that the problems identified can be targeted more accurately and addressed. In the Tribunal’s view, in the context of this project, data gathering and analysis with regard to the nature of potential impact on the wildlife migratory corridor and dispersal area that might arise from this development and the adjustments needed to manage impacts, if any, is not a one-off exercise: it must be seen as a long term undertaking during the life of this project. In the Tribunal’s view, the right of wildlife to occupy this habitat must not be compromised by the developments taking place in the area.",
            "The Mitigation Measures",
            "In denying the Appellants the EIA licence, the Respondents stated that the mitigation measures proposed would not adequately address the anticipated potential environmental impacts of the project. This ground for denial of the EIA licence was supported by the Interested Parties. Given the scope of the project, the environmental issues arising range widely. The Tribunal considers that the EIA Study Report comprehensively identified the environmental concerns which needed attention through the inclusion in the design of the project of mitigation measures.",
            "The full list of issues and the proposed mitigation measures are at pages 39 to 63 of Chapter 6 of the EIA Study Report. They include political, socio-economic and socio-cultural impacts; crime; human wildlife conflict; drinking water supply; liquid and solid waste management and pollution control; and urban sprawl. Human-wildlife conflict, the potential for urban sprawl, and the disposal of waste water were particularly contentious before the Tribunal. The Tribunal has already considered issues arising relating to the impact of this project on wildlife in the context of its discussion of the location of this project, as well as issues arising from the settlement in the area of people perceived as outsiders.",
            "The EIA proposed that the concern that an inflow of 10,000 people would alter the traditional voting patterns in the local area and introduce a potential for a clash of cultures and social disruption could be redressed through a process of voter education to encourage voters to focus, in choosing leaders, on issues and not on ethnic or clan affiliation. Resort could also be had to strengthened law enforcement agencies and community conflict resolution mechanisms, such as village elders to deal with these concerns as well as with crime. The mitigation measures related to the impacts on wildlife revolved around greater clarity in Government policy about the future of Nairobi National Park, and an examination of the possibility of managing the National Park as a closed system. These issues have been the subject of findings by the Tribunal in the context of the Tribunal’s consideration of the issues relating to the location of the project above.",
            "As regards solid waste management, the construction of two sanitary landfills at sites which had already been identified, was proposed. The shortage of drinking water in an area classified as semi-arid was also identified as a problem. The EIA Study Report proposed that drinking water would be sourced from boreholes drilled both within the housing estate and, for the use of the local community members who do not reside in the estate, outside the estate. The EIA Study identified the high flouride content in the ground water in the area as a potential problem, and proposed de-fluoridization as a mitigation measure to bring the levels down to the recommended World Health Organization standard of 1.5 ppm. Solid waste management would be provided through sanitary landfills to be constructed within the estate, the sites of which had been identified. The concern that the landfills would be, in effect, dumpsites, arises from the confusion in the minds of many caused by the poor management of many landfills in Kenyan urban centers. There is no doubt that properly managed sanitary landfills are perfectly capable of dealing with solid waste management requirements of an urban settlement.",
            "The EIA Study Report identified as a potential problem the likely mushrooming of unplanned settlements in the neighbourhood areas of the new town. Urban sprawl occurs particularly because of the lack of effective physical planning and development control systems around towns. It exacerbates the adverse effects of urbanization. In the case of this project, the contrast between a well planned and well managed housing estate co-existing in close proximity with an unplanned settlement lacking in basic facilities would be a most undesirable consequence of the proposed development. Leaving the issue wholly to the physical planning authorities to deal with will not suffice.",
            "The statutory responsibility to control unplanned settlement lies with the local authorities. Such authorities, and Ol Kejuado County Council is no exception,  face serious constraints in carrying out their statutory responsibilities. If urban sprawl is to be contained, the developers of this project will need to work with Ol Kejuado Council to put in place plans and systems to manage and control urban sprawl.  This support should also be budgeted for and included as an integral aspect of this project. The Tribunal believes that this would further mitigate the potential negative environmental impacts that might arise from the project. Clearly, the containment of urban sprawl is not a one-off activity, but must be seen as a continuous undertaking during the life of the project which, in due course, should gradually be left to the local authority as its capacity to carry out its statutory duties improves.",
            "The arrangements for waste water disposal was dealt with at length before the Tribunal. The liquid waste (sewage) is to be managed through a hybrid constructed wetlands facility which has been designed by Stroutel Afrique Engineering Consultants, whose civil engineer, Engineer Wilberforce Odhiambo gave evidence before the Tribunal. The facility is described at page 35 to 36 of the EIA Study Report. The Report indicates that the underlying principle of the design is that of realizing significant reductions in suspended solids, bio-degradable organics (e.g. COD and BOD) and removal of pathogens, nutrients, refractory organics, heavy metals and dissolved solids. At page 35 it is said to consist of:",
            "“(1) An inlet/screening chamber to trap or filter out solid waste, plastics, and trash accompanying the waste water; (2) a lined balancing tank to facilitate sedimentation of sludge, stabilize flow throughput, enhance bio-degradation to miscible liquids, precondition waste and prevent the transportation of grit, and ensure that only liquid waste goes into the gravel bed hydroponics (GBH); (3) two GBHs to significantly reduce the BOD, COD and total suspended solids in the waste through aerobic and  anaerobic processes; (4) two facultative ponds to expose the waste to sunlight and air which would further enhance aerobic and anaerobic processes  of waste water; (5) four maturation ponds whose plant habitat would absorb pollutants such as heavy metals, lower BOD, COD and total suspended solids, and also destroy pathogens in waste water; and (6) one balancing pond to serve as storage for treated waste water.”",
            "At page 34 it is said that the design incorporates a sewerage conveyance system consisting of:",
            "(a)  “Distribution and trunk sewers to collect sewage from the developed plots and convey it to the treatment plant;",
            "(b)  Sewage treatment plant developed to condition the sewage to WHO/Ministry of Health standards of not more than 25 mg/l BOD and 50 mg/l COD and 30 mg/l suspended solids;",
            "(c)  Outfall to discharge the treated sewage to the receiving waters, however the sewerage shall have a balancing pond from where part of the water can be recycled  for watering trees and gardens and the rest flow into adjacent streams north and south of the town.",
            "(d)  Operation and maintenance of support facilities of buildings, plants and equipment.”",
            "The EIA Study Report states that, if properly built, maintained, and operated, constructed wetlands can effectively remove many pollutants associated with municipal and industrial wastewater and storm water. BOD will be reduced to 25 mg/l and COD to 50 mg/l, standards which represent Kenyan and World Health Organization standards. Examples of other constructed wetlands in Kenya were given to demonstrate that the proposed system has proved itself elsewhere to be an effective waste water treatment system. At page 60 of the Report, it is acknowledged, however, that discharge of excess waste water to local watercourses could harm organisms and animal habitat  through the accumulation of solids and toxic substances and the depletion of oxygen through the decomposition of organic material. Discharges can arise also from an overflow from the wetlands during flooding.",
            "The Respondents and the Interested Parties challenged this design. Mr. Robert Ndetei from KWS testified that he was a wetlands expert, and that, in his view, the plants to be grown in the facultative ponds would reduce the effectiveness of the facultative ponds because their roots would reduce the aeration of the ponds. Similarly, the plants to be grown in the GBHs would be difficult to manage, as access to the GBHs would be limited. In his view, ideally, the plants should be grown in the maturation ponds, although to do so would require extra land. He thought that, although in the initial years the design could work, its efficiency would diminish with time, as the vegetation in the ponds reduced aeration.",
            "The waste water disposal design was challenged also on account of the fact that it incorporates an outfall to discharge the treated sewage into the two watercourses north and south of the town, notwithstanding that most of the treated water would be recycled for watering trees and gardens, and that, prior to the discharge, the treated water would have been treated to Ministry of Health and WHO standards of 25 mg/l BOD and 50 mg/l COD and 30 mg/l suspended solids.  The risk of pollution of the receiving waters was stressed, particularly the fact that, in this water scarce locality, the natural watercourses are used as sources of drinking water by human beings, domestic animals and wildlife. The perception that people would be drinking water contaminated with sewage would cause offence, even if, scientifically, it could be shown that the waste water had been treated to acceptable standards.",
            "The weight to be given to objections based on the offence caused by perception of contamination was addressed in the New Zealand case of Robert Te Kotahi  Mahuta v The Waikato Regional Council  & Anchor Products Ltd, reported in the Compendium of Judicial Decisions on Matters Related to Environment: National Decisions, Volume II at page 214. Anchor Products Ltd sought consent to expand its dairy factory and install a gas fired cogeneration plant to supply energy to the milk processing plant. Among the objections to the application by the Maori people of New Zealand was the claim that there would be adverse effects of taking water from the river and discharging contaminants into it. Witnesses testified that there was no need for discernible physical adverse impacts - even the perception of contaminants flowing into the river would cause offence. The Environmental Court examined the practical difficulties of disposing of the liquid waste to land, which would have avoided the perception of contamination to the river, and ruled that “perceptions which are not represented by tangible effects do not deserve such a weight as to prevail over the proposal and defeat it.”",
            "The Tribunal is of the view that the project proponent must apply all reasonably practicable measures to avoid contamination of neighbouring watercourses arising from the discharge of waste water. If there are additional practicable measures that can be taken, within reason, to avoid discharging the treated waste water to receiving waters, they must be adopted. In this regard the project proponent shall re-examine the waste water disposal design with a view to ascertaining the nature of adjustments that can be incorporated into it further to reduce the risk of contamination of watercourses through the discharge of waste water. The Tribunal observes that, prior to construction of the waste water disposal facility, should the design still comprise an outfall for discharge of excess treated water to the neighbouring rivers, a permit from the Water Resources Management Authority, established under the Water Act, 2002, will be required.",
            "The Tribunal considers that, despite claims to the contrary by the Respondents and the Interested Parties, the mitigation measures which have been put forward to deal with the issues identified in Chapter 6 of the EIA Study Report are, on the whole, well thought out and capable of being implemented. The Tribunal listened to the experts who carried out the EIA Study, including Prof. Elijah Biamah as well as Eng. Wilberforce Odhiambo, who designed the waste water disposal facility. They impressed the Tribunal as being authoritative, and in matters of professional opinion, their testimony is to be preferred. The Tribunal sees no reason to conclude that the mitigation measures they have proposed would not be adequate to deal with the identified environmental concerns, notwithstanding that the proposed measures can be enhanced further along the lines which the Tribunal has indicated.",
            "Should it happen that the project is not implemented in accordance with the statements made in the EIA Study Report, as was claimed before the Tribunal might happen, the Respondents have the power under section 67 of EMCA to suspend the licence until corrective measures are taken. Additionally, under section 68(4) the project proponent is placed under an obligation to take all reasonable measures to mitigate any undesirable effects not contemplated in the EIA Study Report.  It should also be kept in mind that, notwithstanding the grant of an EIA or other licence or permit allowing an activity to be implemented, NEMA and other regulatory and enforcement authorities retain their powers to take enforcement action, where this is called for, to ensure that the licensed development activities do not cause negative environmental impact. In the Tribunal’s view, therefore, failure to identify potentially adverse impacts or even to provide adequate mitigation measures is not necessarily fatal to an application for an EIA licence.",
            "The future of the project",
            "The Respondents cited, as a basis for denying the Appellants the EIA licence, the ground that the future cumulative environmental impacts of the project are uncertain given the enormity of the project. In their written submissions to the Tribunal, the Respondents pointed to the uncertainties surrounding the future of the wildlife in the Athi Kapiti ecosystem, and the survival of Nairobi National Park. They argued that cumulative impacts arising out of the Jamii Bora project will have “disastrous consequences and cause serious injury and irreparable damage.” The Respondents’ lawyer urged the Tribunal to rely on the principle of precaution, which, it was said, requires “vigilance and prevention on account of the often irreversible character of damage to the environment and the limitations inherent in the very mechanism of reparation of this type of damage,” quoting from the International Court of Justice Decision in The Case Concerning the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia, 1997, General List, No 92). ",
            "The Appellants described this ground for denying them the EIA licence as “vague, general, and not supported by any facts, evidence or material whatsoever.” They contended that the future cumulative environmental impacts of the project were known and were addressed in the EIA Study Report, which showed that the proposed project would, in fact, improve an environment that presently is inhospitable, degraded and lacking in basic amenities. The project will introduce agro-forestry, recreational parks, health and educational facilities, infrastructure such as a paved road, electric power and drinking water supply, all of which would benefit the local population. The Appellants argued that they had relied on the best experts available in the country and there is available the required scientific knowledge and technology to deal with potentially negative consequences, if any arise. ",
            "During the proceedings before the Tribunal, doubt was cast on the viability of this project. Questions were raised by the Respondents and the Interested Parties as to how it can be expected that the poor people who make up the members of Jamii Bora will sustain the project. Describing the project as “donor driven,” counsel for the Interested Parties argued that, once the donor leaves, the project, inevitably, will collapse, since the low income residents will be unable to keep it going without donor support. The Interested Parties argued that this was all the more likely as the residents, previously eking out a living as casual workers in Nairobi, would be unable to travel to and from Nairobi daily to earn a living and would therefore not manage to keep up with the payments for the housing and other services needed to maintain the project. They might, consequently, either sell the houses to the middle class and return to the slums or simply continue to occupy them without paying for the upkeep of the estate, waiting for another donor to come to their aid.",
            "From the testimony of Mr. Maurice Mbegera, NEMA’s Director of Compliance and Enforcement, and others, it became clear that both the Interested Parties and the Respondents had assumed that Jamii Bora was a foreign funded organization, and that this housing project was to be built using donor funds, after which the donor would withdraw and let the beneficiaries fend for themselves. When that happens, they argued, sewerage systems and solid waste management systems, educational and health facilities, drinking water supply and other facilities will collapse, leading to serious adverse environmental effects. They had also assumed that the occupants of the proposed housing estate earned a living as casual labourers in Nairobi’s industrial areas and intended to commute to and from Nairobi to continue working as casual labourers in Nairobi. On the basis of those assumptions, the Respondents and Interested Parties saw the project as unsustainable and its future as uncertain.",
            "In her evidence, Mrs. Ingrid Munro sought to explain the nature of the organization and the project concept and design. Jamii Bora has a Board of Trustees made up of six prominent individuals, four Kenyans and two non-Kenyans. The Managing Trustee, Ingrid Munro, is a Kenyan resident. The organization is a member driven organization registered in Kenya as a Trust. It strives to empower the poor to realize their potential through self-help and the provision of micro-credit. Members, the majority of whom are small scale traders running kiosks and hawking on the streets, make small regular contributions from their income towards a pool of funds from which other members may borrow money to invest in their small businesses. No collateral is required and the guarantee of repayment comes from the social pressure from other members: failure to repay threatens one’s membership. From the testimony of Beatrice Sabana, Chief Executive of the Association of Micro Finance Institutions, micro-credit is the principal way in which poor people access credit.",
            "The housing project was conceived of in order to provide the members with an opportunity to own their own houses in a decent environment, away from the slums. A key feature of the concept was affordability. The land needed to be spacious but at the same time not prohibitively expensive. Upgrading the slums in Nairobi was out of the question: the land is expensive, small and, in any case, not available for acquisition by a non-governmental organization to use for its members. The purchase price of the houses, at Kshs 150,000/- had to be low enough to enable the members afford to repay the monthly mortgage payments from the income derived from their trade. Only members who met pre-set criteria could qualify to be allowed to purchase a house: a non-member would not be eligible, and therefore the project could not be “hijacked” by the middle class. The relocated members, being traders, will continue with their trade in the nearby towns and villages and earn their living that way: there will be no need for them to commute to Nairobi daily. ",
            "From the evidence of Ingrid Munro, the key to the viability and sustainability of this project lies in the pooling of resources by many low income people, which enables them to build up a capital base that is substantial enough to be able to undertake a major housing project, such as the one proposed. Continued pooling of resources after occupation of the houses will enable the residents to meet the costs of maintaining the housing estate, including its facilities. In order to ensure that that happens, the project design provides for the establishment of a Management Board, which will be responsible for collecting and making payments and for running the services and maintaining the facilities. The Board will also procure experts at a fee to provide technical input.",
            "102.  The Tribunal sees no reason to doubt that this concept can work. Systems for pooling resources to meet common objectives as well as residents associations formed for purposes of maintaining housing estates are known in Kenya. What is proposed in this particular case is to apply known ideas and systems to meeting the housing needs of members. It is also worth remembering that the Jamii Bora Charitable Trust, as the applicant for the EIA licence, is responsible for ensuring compliance with the obligations of licence. It is a Kenyan, not a foreign, organization, registered under the Trustees (Perpetual Succession) Act. This Act requires that the appointment of every new trustee shall be certified by the Minister. Consequently, the Minister will at all times know the particulars of the Trustees who, ultimately, are responsible for ensuring the viability and sustainability of this project. The risk of the project’s sponsor in future abandoning the project and leaving behind serious environmental damage does not therefore appear to be any more serious with regard to this project than with regard to any other project.",
            "Alleged irregularities and breaches of the law",
            "103.  During the proceedings, and in their written submissions, counsel for the Respondents and the Interested Parties argued that the Appellants were not eligible to be issued with an EIA licence because they had not complied with certain requirements of the law, including their failure to give alternative locations for the project. They argued also that the planning permission which the Appellants had obtained from the Ol Kejuado County Council was irregular and invalid. In any case the Appellants had not yet obtained the consent of the Land Control Board which they required to change the use of the land from agricultural to commercial, and they had not yet surrendered the title deed for the land in exchange for a certificate of lease as required by the Registered Land Act, Chapter 300. The Interested Parties, through their counsel, submitted additionally that because the Appellants had failed to commence their project after the lapse of three months from the date of their application, they had waived their right to the licence.",
            "104.  For his part, counsel for the Appellants alleged that the Respondents had committed breaches of several legal and procedural requirements, which separately and cumulatively vitiated their decision not to grant the EIA licence. The breaches cited were failure to gazette the EIA Study Report; failure to set up a technical advisory committee on the Appellant’s project properly; allowing the 1st Respondent, the Director General of the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA), to participate in and take over the conduct of the proceedings of the public hearing; holding the public hearing out of time and irregularly; and purporting to determine the application after the mandatory three months.",
            "105.  Regulation 18 of the Environmental (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations, LN No 101 of 2003 of EMCA (the EIA Regulations) states that the EIA Study Report shall contain “an analysis of alternatives including project site…” The Respondents argued that the Appellants had not provided alternative sites for comparison. It was suggested that the alternative of implementing the project in the slums should be considered. For reasons already adverted to, upgrading the slums was not feasible. The developer therefore looked elsewhere. Before buying land in Kisaju, they had considered acquiring land in Thika as well as in Kiambu but they could not afford the land there, and bought this land when it became available.",
            "106.  The Tribunal does not consider that an analysis of alternative sites is always practicable. A developer cannot reasonably be expected to compare the potential impacts of developing a project on a site which he owns as against the potential impacts of developing the project on another alternative site, which he does not own. Such a comparison would not be meaningful, as the developer may well not be able to acquire the alternative site. Yet, a developer cannot be expected to acquire alternative sites for the sole reason of comparing the potential impacts of the proposed project on those alternative sites.",
            "107.  Counsel for the Respondents also argued that the planning permission which the Appellants had obtained was irregular. Evidence was given by the Chairman of Ol Kejuado County Council, Councillor Julius ole Ntayia and by Mr. Patrick Waweru, the Kajiado District Physical Planner that the title deed owned by the developer should have been surrendered in exchange for a certificate of lease, but this was not done; that the advertisement in the newspaper of the application for planning permission came after the actual planning permission had been issued; that the recommendations of the District Physical Planning Liaison Committee on the application for planning permission had been provided after the local authority had given its decision; and that a full meeting of the Council had not been held to consider the application for planning permission as required by the rules.",
            "108.  To these alleged irregularities counsel for the Appellants responded that the developer had applied for, and obtained, planning permission not once, but twice, because it had been noticed that the first time the application was made, it was not advertised. The process was therefore repeated a second time, hence the confusion in the minds of the Respondents’ witnesses. According to the Appellants, there was no irregularity at all, and the Appellants supplied a bundle of materials dealing with the application for planning permission, and change of use from agricultural use to commercial cum residential use as an annexure to the EIA Study Report at pages 204 to 207.",
            "109.  The Tribunal does not consider that it has to make a positive finding on these issues. As the Tribunal has had occasion to state before, in Nakummat Holdings Ltd v The National Environment Management Authority, Kenya Gazette No 85 of 9th December, 2005 Vol. CVII No 85 page 3027 at 3028, the Tribunal does not sit on Appeal from the decisions of physical planning authorities. That function has been vested by Part V of the Physical Planning Act, Chapter 286 in the relevant Physical Planning Liaison Committee. Remedies to deal with irregularities, if any, with regard to the planning permission that has been obtained, or an alleged failure to comply with mandatory statutory requirements, such as the requirement to surrender a freehold title deed in exchange for a certificate of lease, must be sought within the framework of the relevant laws dealing with those issues. In the same vein, in the Tribunal’s respectful view, Regulation 4(2) of the EIA Regulations - which suggests that other licencing authorities may not issue licences under their own statutes unless the applicant has already procured an EIA licence - is ultra vires section 58 of EMCA. ",
            "110.  The Appellants alleged that the Respondents had not given their decision within three months as required by regulation 23(1) of the EIA Regulations. The Respondents explained that they were awaiting the report of the Chairman of the public hearing held on 11th December 2004, and this report came after the end of the three month period. The application for an EIA licence was lodged by the Appellants on 15th September 2004, and the decision was delivered on 14th January 2005. In the Tribunal’s view, there is an acceptable explanation for the delay in delivering the decision. To the Interested Parties submission that, in not carrying the project after the lapse of three months, the Appellants had waived their right to an EIA licence, the Tribunal would only note that the choice by an applicant for an EIA licence to await a formal communication of the Authority’s decision cannot be held against the applicant.",
            "111.  The Tribunal has considered the argument that the Respondents did not properly set up a Technical Advisory Committee and is satisfied that the rules do not necessarily require that a Technical Advisory Committee be set up specifically for a project, and the use of an existing Technical Advisory Committee, as was done in this case, to consider an application, is not irregular. The Tribunal also accepts the Respondents’ evidence that they did notify the Applicant of the Applicant’s responsibility to advertise the application in the Gazette. The omission to advertise in this case cannot be blamed on the Respondents. With regard to the public hearing, the evidence that was adduced indicated that the Director General of NEMA attended and participated in the public hearing. A reading of regulation 22 of the EIA Regulations does not show that the presence and participation of the Director General at the public hearing is irregular, even if one might consider that it is not good practice, as it might constrain the conduct of the public hearing.",
            "ORDER",
            "112.  On the basis of its findings on the issues arising, the Tribunal unanimously makes the following order:",
            "(a)  The Respondents’ decision dated 14th January 2005 denying the Appellants an EIA licence for the proposed project be and is hereby set aside;",
            "(b)   An EIA licence be and is hereby issued for the Appellants’ project, subject to the following conditions:",
            "i.   The project proponent shall incorporate, as an integral part of the project, a wildlife surveillance outpost, to be designed and operated in collaboration with KWS and other relevant stakeholders, and an arrangement for tagging some animals, in particular migratory ones such as wildebeest and zebra, to ascertain the extent of the migratory corridor and dispersal area in order to facilitate the monitoring of their movements to and from Nairobi National Park, and their response to the new housing development. This is in order to provide a system for data gathering on wildlife behaviour and to inform decision making about the action needed to minimize adverse impacts on wildlife;",
            "ii.   The project proponent shall examine what additional practicable measures can be taken to avoid discharging the treated waste water into watercourses, and shall incorporate into its wastewater treatment design such further measures as can be adopted which are practicable and cost effective. No direct discharges to watercourses shall be made without the permission of the Water Resources Management Authority under the Water Act, 2002. This is in order to minimize the offence caused by the perception that local watercourses risk being contaminated by discharges from the wastewater disposal system, as well as by an overflow from the system that may occur during floods. Further the project proponent shall ensure that technical experts are procured to manage the waste water disposal system;",
            "iii.   The project proponent, in collaboration with Ol Kejuado County Council and other relevant stakeholders, shall put in place, as an integral part of the management of the housing estate, plans and systems for controlling urban sprawl including the provision of reasonable and cost effective technical and administrative support to the County Council for this purpose. This is in order to minimize the risk of uncontrolled urban sprawl arising from this development;",
            "iv.   The project proponent, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders,  shall set up systems for managing community relations and shall ensure that, as far as possible, the benefits of the project which have been planned for local community members, who are not members of Jamii Bora, are available on an equitable basis, to all members of the local community who wish to access them, regardless of the views they have expressed with regard to this project. This is in order to facilitate harmonious community relations and to reduce the prevailing tensions between the members of the local community who hold differing views with regard to the proposed project;",
            "v.   In implementing the project, the project proponent shall ensure that the Environmental Management Plan provided in the EIA Study Report is complied with, and shall also obtain all required permits, licences and authorizations under the relevant laws; and",
            "vi.   The project proponent shall ensure that information regarding the project and mitigation measures is availed to all relevant stakeholders in order to enable them make informed decisions about the project and to minimize misunderstandings with regard to what is intended.",
            "113.  The above conditions shall be and are hereby integrated into the EIA licence and NEMA shall act within its mandate under EMCA to monitor the compliance with these conditions during project implementation.  The Tribunal notes that the EIA licence application fee of Kshs 600,000/- has already been paid to the 2nd Respondent by the Appellants. The receipt for this payment was annexed to the documents submitted by the Appellants in support of the Appeal. Accordingly, no further licence fees is payable for the licence granted herein.",
            "114.   The Parties, including the Intervenors, asked for costs to be awarded as part of the determination of the Appeal. The award of costs by the Tribunal is governed by rule 39 of the National Environment Tribunal Procedure Rules, LN No 191 of 2003. The Tribunal has taken into account the public importance of the subject matter of this Appeal, and the complexity of the issues which it dealt with. Additionally, the issues argued by the Parties, including the Interested Parties, before the Tribunal were serious issues, requiring consideration by the Tribunal. Further, in the Tribunal’s view, Parties conducted the Appeal with the seriousness it deserved. The Tribunal therefore does not see this as a fitting case in which to award costs against any Party.

In fact, the actual prayer in the application sought, injunction “pending the hearing and determination of this suit” while the application itself was made under order 40 rules 1 and 2 which applies only to temporary injunctions pending the hearing and determination of suits. Both counsels appearing in the matter did not address their minds at all to the fact that this was an application for injunction pending appeal. The Appellant’s application ought to",

There is no mention at all in the application about the decision of the lower court which is appealed against and the merit of the appeal lodged before this court. The principles which this court applies in applications for temporary injunction pending the hearing and determination of a suit under Order 40 of the Civil Procedure Rules are different from those applicable to applications for temporary injunction pending the hearing and determination of appeal under Order 42 rule 6 (6). Under order 40 of the Civil Procedure Rules, an applicant for a temporary injunction needs only to satisfy the principles that were pronounced in the case of Giella –vs- Cassman Brown & Company Limited [1973] E.A. 358 by showing a prima facie case with a probability of success and that unless, the orders sought are granted, he will suffer irreparable loss that cannot be compensated in damages.

It is for this reason that the court can only exercise the power once an applicant has complied with the procedure of instituting an appeal. In the present appeal, what the appellant has filed is only a memorandum of appeal.  The Appellant has not furnished the court with the pleadings and proceedings in the lower court. The court was not furnished even with a certified copy of the ruling of the learned senior resident magistrate which is being appealed.

Cap.234, Laws of Kenya (which is hereinafter referred to as the Act); and his reference, together with the statutory certificate from the Labour Commission under Section 14(9)(e) of the Act, were received by the Court on 28th May, 2001. Mr. Omolo for the Union submitted his written memorandum on 10th July 2001, and the learned counsel for the Company, Mr. Nyaberi, filed his reply statement on 16th August, 2001. On a number of occasions, the parties took several adjournments for one reason or another, and the opening submissions were eventually heard on 12th June, 2002, while the final submissions were made on 1st August, 2002.",

            "\tAs a result of the Court awards in Causes Nos. 51 of 1996 and 27 of 1999, the parties signed a valid recognition agreement and also entered into a two years’ collective agreement for the period 1st March, 1998 to 28th February, 2000. (see Union Apps. I(a) & (b) and 2(a) & (b) ). The Company employ a total workforce of 38 employees, but the present dispute, which arose when the parties were negotiating the renewal or review of their said collective agreement, affects only 17 unionisable employees, whose total consolidated monthly wage bill amounts to Kshs.83,181/=, or an annual wage bill of Kshs.998,172/=. The Union forwarded its proposals to the Company on 27th March, 2000, but the latter declined to negotiate. On 29th June, 2000, the Union reported a formal trade dispute to the Minister for Labour in accordance with Section 4 of the Act. The Minister accepted, or took cognisance of, the dispute; and, in exercise of his powers under Section 6(2)(a) of the Act, appointed Mr. J.M. Kiraguri of Ministry of Labour Headquarters to act as the Conciliator. However, during their subsequent conciliation meetings, the parties were unable to agree. The management of the Company also refused to sign the Notification of Dispute, Form ‘A’,",
            "\tfor adjudication and determination of this dispute by the Court. Under the circumstances, the Minister for Labour invoked Section 8 of the Act as aforestated (see Union Apps. 3 to 15).",
            "\tThe case of the Union was that the Company has ability to pay because it has no competitors apart from Jua Kali sector. Mr. Omolo also urged the Court to ignore the wage increase of 20%, which the Company voluntarily awarded to the employees during the period under consideration.",
            "\tOn the other hand, the learned counsel for the Company, Mr. Nyaberi, pleaded inability to pay due to poor business performance or state of the economy, which has faced depression or slump and has also forced many companies out of business, including some giant industries in engineering sector. He submitted that the operations and business of the Company were purely run on bank loans, which attract very high interest rates. He pointed out that the operations of the Company do not require any specialized skills on the part of the employees because most of the work is performed by, or contracted to, a contractor and the employees who are actually idle most of the time are only left with fairly simple task of fixing and joining the parts which are already manufactured.",
            "\tMr. Nyaberi contended further that, since the Company’s business is seasonal and also owing to stiff competition from other companies, the Company is not able to break-even and is considering many options, including entering into a new line of production altogether or dismantling down all the machines, and lease out the godowns to other people and/or relocate the entire business to a country outside Kenya owing to high cost of production. In the meantime, however, the Company is seriously considering retrenching all the staff on permanent terms of employment, and award all the work to the contractor who will re-employ or re-engage them, if they will still be interested . He averred that it was very unfair for the Union to demand another increment soon after the Company had voluntarily given 20% wage increase to the employees; otherwise the said increment should be off-set against the demand.",
            "\tIn their analysis and observations for the relevant period in this dispute, the Economic and Planning Division (which is hereinafter referred to as the EPD) have stated in a nutshell that the management of the Company refused or declined to either respond to the questionnaire sent to it or to furnish them with their audited accounts on the ground that the same were confidential, and that the Company was not in business with a view to sharing profits with the employees. However, there was a power rationing during the year 2000, which forced the Company to purchase a generator on loan, worth Kshs.2 million and the running costs of the same is Kshs.5,000/= per day, and there are currently too intermittent problems with water supply.",
            "\tWith the foregoing observations in view, and after consultation with the two members of the Court, I now proceed to consider seriatim all the issues before me and award accordingly.",
            "1.     Basic Monthly Minimums.",
            "\tThe Union demanded that the current minimums be improved by 25% for the first year and another 25% for the second year, or 50% for the two years’ period, while the Company maintained that the same are already far above statutory minimum rates.",
            "\t During their investigation, the EPD established that the basic minimum wages in the parties’ collective agreement have been overtaken by the statutory wage rates of 1st May, 2000 and 1st May, 2001. The current consolidated monthly pay ranges between Kshs.4,000/= for watchmen and machine attendants and Kshs.8,560/= for a heavy vehicle driver. These rates, which include 15% housing element or consideration, are below the statutory minimum rates that became effective on 1st May, 2001, for certain categories of employees, e.g. sales clerk, lorry driver, machine attendants and electrician.",
            "\tMinimum wages, as the name itself implies, represents the level below which wage cannot be allowed to drop; and it is a well established principle of industrial law, and universally recognised that management must pay minimum wages to the employees whether it earns any profits or not. Thus, the term minimum wages is the lowest wage in the scale below which the efficiency of the employee is likely to be impaired. It is the “wage floor”, allowing at a standard considered socially, medically and ethically acceptable.",
            "\tAccording to the EPD report the basic minimum wages in the Company’s establishment are below the statutory minimum rates of 1st May, 2000 and 1st May, 2001. The legal position is that no employee should earn less than the statutory minimum rate of pay, and for this reason I award that the basic minimum wages in the Company’s concern be brought up to the current statutory minimum rates of pay pursuant to the General Wages Orders for the years 2000 to 2003.",
            "2.     General Wage Increase.",
            "\tThe Union demanded a general wage increase as follows:-",
            "\t(a)      1st year, w.e.f. 1.3.2000 – 40%,",
            "\t(b)      2nd year, w.e.f. 1.3.2001 - 40%,",
            "\tor a total of 80% for the two years’ period.",
            "\tThe Company, however, pleaded inability to meet the demand beyond the 20% wage increase which was allegedly awarded to the employees with effect from January, 2001.",
            "\tThe Union conceded that an increase was given, but challenged the assertion by the Company that it amounted to 20%; and in support of its contention, it submitted two payment or salary vouchers for one employee in respect of December, 2000, i.e. before the increase, and February, 2001, i.e. after the increase, which showed that the consolidated pay went up from Kshs.4,948.10 to Kshs.5,700/=, i.e. an increase of 15.2%.",
            "\tThe EPD worked out two sets of cost of living compensation entitlement, based on the Union’s demand that the effective date of the new collective agreement should be 1st March, 2000, and on the Company’s position that there should be no back-dating of the effective date. The unionisable employees fall in the middle income group; and if the demand by the Union is granted the employees would be entitled to compensation of 10% for the rise in the cost of living, but if the effective date is not back-dated the compensation entitlement would be 17.7%. In the circumstances, the Union’s demand, if granted, would raise the wage bill by Kshs.347,200/= for the first year and a further Kshs.486,080/= for the second year, or a total of Kshs.833,780/= for the two years’ period. On the other hand,",
            "\tif the Company’s position is upheld, the additional wage bill would be Kshs.130,172/= each year. However, the consumer price indices entitlement, based on a two year compensation period, would hike the wage bill by a total of Kshs.88,970/=, and if the effective date is not back-dated, the wage bill would rise by Kshs.161,379/=.",
            "\tAs I have observed on numerous occasions before, the primary objective in deciding trade or industrial disputes with regard to wage increase to the employees is and has to be the ability of the Company to pay and the restoration of peace, harmony and good will in the industry concerned so as to do justice to the interests of both labour and capital. Considering the small number of employees engaged by the Company and the 20% voluntary wage increase already given, I am of the opinion that the demand by the Union of a further 40% wage increase each year, or 80% for the two years’ period, as very high and unreasonable. This being the case, and keeping in view the submissions of the parties on this issue, I am constrained to award an additional general wage increase of 10% each year, or 20% for the two years’ period, and I so order.",
            "3.     House Allowance.",
            "\tThe employees are presently entitled to house allowance of 15% of their individual current consolidated basic monthly wage.",
            "\tThe Union demanded 30%, or a minimum of Kshs.2,000/= per month, house allowance for the first year, and a further 30%, or a minimum of Kshs.2,500/= per month, for the second year for any employee who is not provided with free accommodation by the Company.",
            "\tThe Company maintained that the prevailing house allowance rates are fair and reasonable.",
            "\tThe EPD report shows that most of the employees live in Dandora where the average rent for 10’ x 10’ rooms is Kshs.2,000/= per month, while others reside or stay in Mathare North and Kayole Estates. The Union contended that the present house allowance does not adequately cater for the rents in these areas. The EPD also established that the proportion of the house allowance is about Kshs.150,000/= out of the present wage bill of Kshs.998,172/= per year; and the demand by the Union, if granted, would raise the current house allowance bill by Kshs.360,000/=, while the consumer price indices entitlement would raise it by Kshs.7,594/= and Kshs.13,804/= for the period under consideration.",
            "\tThere is no gainsaying the fact that decent and reasonable accommodation is scarce and unaffordable, particularly in urban centres, and landlords have been quick to exploit the situation to the disadvantage of the public, especially employees of low income wages or earnings (see: Cause No.38 of 1997: Tailors & Textiles Workers’ Union v.

            "\tOn careful consideration of the submissions by the parties on this issue, and keeping in view Wage Guideline 2(ii) and (iv) and the above legal position imposed upon every employer, I am inclined to improve the present house allowance entitlement of 15% of the individual employee’s current consolidated basic monthly wage by 2.5%, to make it 17.5% house allowance of the individual employee’s basic monthly wage, and I award accordingly.",
            "4.     Leave Travelling Allowance.",
            "\tClause 8 of the parties’ outgoing collective agreement provides that:-",
            "\t“After each period of twelve months of continuous service with the company an employee shall be entitled when proceeding on annual leave, to leave travelling allowance of sh.1,500.00 per annum”.",
            "\tThe Union demanded that the present leave travelling allowance be raised to Kshs.3,000/= during the first year and Kshs.3,500/= during the second year, to enable the employee and his family members travel home and back.",
            "\tThe Company felt that the current amount is fair and reasonable. ",
            "\tThe EPD report shows that 7 of the unionisable employees come from Eastern Province, 4 come from Western Province, another 4 come from Nyanza Province and 2 come from Central Province. The demand by the Union, if allowed, will raise the leave travelling allowance bill from the current amount of Kshs.25,000/= to Kshs.51,000/= for the first year, and to a further Kshs.59,500/= for the second year.",
            "\tUnfortunately, the EPD report does not show any fares of various destinations; but, as I have observed in my several awards before, leave travelling allowance is personal to the employee himself or herself. In my considered opinion, however, and keeping in view the unpredictable and escalating transport costs, I award that an employee be paid Kshs.1,750/= as leave travelling allowance when he or she proceeds on annual leave.",

            "\tIncidentally, the EPD established that Mr. Gabriel Mutual, Assistant Shopsteward, died or passed away in May, 2000, and the Company contributed Kshs.25,000/=, out of which Kshs.8,000/= was its own contribution, but the balance of Kshs.17,000/= was recovered by the Company from the deceased’s terminal benefits. The Union argued that the Company had, prior to the signing of the first collective agreement, voluntarily contributed Kshs.25,000/=, towards funeral expenses, and it should keep it that way.",

            "7.     Casual Workers.",
            "\tClause 25 of the parties’ collective agreement only provides for mode of payment of daily rates of pay, i.e. consolidated salary of a permanent employee divided by 26 working days.",
            "\tThe Union demanded that a casual employee who works for the Company for 3 consecutive months should automatically qualify for permanent employment.",
            "\tThe Company opposed this demand on the ground that casual employees should not automatically qualify for permanent employment upon working for 3 months.",
            "\tThe EPD report shows that there are currently 4 casual employees who have worked for more than 3 consecutive months – 1 of whom has been in employment since 1999, while 3 of them have worked since the year 2000. However, the Union has complained that the current rates of casual employees are not based on consolidated wages as stipulated in the parties’ collective agreement, and the management of the Company did not produce the wage bill for casual employees to confirm the contention.",
            "\tThe question of automatic qualification of a casual employee or probationer for permanent employment is a matter of internal management and no hard and fast rules can be laid down. It is for the management to assess the suitability and competence of an employee for permanent employment or confirmation; and under the circumstances, a reasonable period is required to judge the suitability and competence of the employee before he is confirmed in service. For this reason, I am unable to give any finding on this issue, which is hereby rejected.",
            "8.     Job Classification.",
            "\tThe Union demanded that a job classification should be undertaken before the signing of a new collective agreement on the ground that the current grouping of the employees is faulty, e.g. drivers’ mates, night watchmen and machine attendant should not be placed in Group I, and drivers should not be lumped together with artisans in Group III, while storekeeper and clerks should not be grouped together in Group V.",
            "\tThe Company contended that there is no need to re-classify the employees in view of the fact that a job classification is already in place.",
            "\tThe EPD report shows that, although the above groupings exist, the job categories have each been given a distinct basic salary, except drivers’ mates and storekeepers and clerks in Group V, who are grouped together.",
            "\tThe Company conceded that a job classification has already been undertaken, and it did not see the need for another one. This being the case, I find no merit in the demand, which is rejected.",
            "9.     Shopstewards’ Rights.",
            "\tThis is a new demand which the Union proposed to be incorporated in the parties’ collective agreement. The Union, demanded that shopstewards should be paid when they are permitted to attend Union meetings and negotiations on behalf of other Union members because their activities also benefit the management of the Company as they “calm down” the employees in cases of industrial unrest.",
            "\tThe Company argued that these are the responsibilities of the Union and the employees themselves, and it has no business knowing how many meetings a shopsteward is required to attend and/or for what reasons. Therefore, the Union or the employees, and not the Company, should meet their expenses.",
            "\tAccording to the EPD report, there are currently in the establishment a Shopsteward, an Assistant Shopsteward, a Chairman and a Secretary for whom the Union has no problem in securing permission to attend Union meetings and negotiations, but the Company does not fund them.",
            "\tThe demand is not substantiated by the Union. Therefore, I see no useful purpose for incorporating this particular clause in the parties’ collective agreement at the moment. Accordingly, the demand is rejected.",
            "10.   Suspension.",
            "\tThis is also a novel demand which the Union proposed that it be inserted in the parties’ collective agreement. The Union demanded that where an employee is suspended from duty to allow for investigation to be carried out, such suspension should be with full pay. However, a decision whether to dismiss or terminate the employee, or whether to withdraw the suspension order, should be made within 10 working days from the date of suspension. The Company was silent on this issue.",
            "\tThe EPD found that, contrary to the assertion by the Union that no suspension has arisen in the recent past, two employees have been dismissed within the past two months for gross misconduct.",
            "\tThe employer’s power to suspend an employee under the ordinary law of master and servant is not an implied term of contract between the master and the servant. Such an order can only be the creature of either a statute governing the contract or of an express term in the contract itself. Therefore, a person under suspension does not by reason of his suspension lose his office nor does he suffer any degradation. He ceases to exercise the powers and to discharge the duties of the office for the time being, but his rank remains the same and his pay does not suffer any deduction. An order of suspension only suspends the contract so far as it relates to performance of duties or enjoyment of privileges, but it does not put an end to the contract itself. During the period an employee remains suspended from duty, he can claim his wages or salary from the employer because, notwithstanding the order of suspension of the employee, the contract of employment is not suspended. In Warburton v. Taff Vale Railway Company; 18 T.L.R.420, it was held that an employee who was suspended from duty for two weeks was entitled to his wages for the period. In Hamley v. Pease & Partners Ltd. (1915), I.K.B.698, an employee absented himself for one day without leave from his employers. The employers did not dismiss him but suspended him from working the following day. Thereby he was prevented from earning the wages he would have earned on that day had he been allowed to work. It was held that the employee was entitled to wages, or damages, representing the amount of his wages, for the day he was not allowed to work.",
            "\tAs regards the period of suspension, there is no provision or rule limiting the period of suspension when it is ordered for the purposes of holding an enquiry. Of course, it is necessary that the enquiry should be held within the shortest possible time; but no hard and fast rule can be laid down as the period required for holding an enquiry. How long such an enquiry can last and on what terms are matters governed by the relevant standing orders, and will also depend on the circumstances of each case. ",
            "\tAccordingly, the demand as it stands is rejected.",
            "11.   Safari Allowance.",
            "Clause 17 of the parties’ agreement provides as follows:-",

            "\tThe EPD report shows that the unionisable employees who are affected by this demand according to the Union are 2 drivers and 2 turnboys, but the Company maintains that there are 3 cantor trucks which make deliveries throughout the country, including Mombasa, Busia, Migori, Kisii, Kisumu, Eldoret, Kitale, e.t.c, on an average duration of 4 days for such trips. However, orders from outside the country are collected by the foreign companies themselves. The report also indicates that the Company did not furnish the EPD with the annual safari allowance bill; otherwise the demand by the Union would raise the daily allowance under this item by Kshs.1,270/= per person.",
            "\tIn the absence of the annual safari allowance bill, and keeping in view the high costs of meals and accommodation, vis-à-vis the demand by the Union, I am constrained to slightly improve the current rates and award as follows:-",

            "\tI find no force in this demand, and would advise the Union to encourage the employees to work hard so as to increase productivity and earn the increments on merit. The demand is, therefore, rejected.",
            "13.       Effective Date and Duration.",
            "\tThe collective agreement under consideration expired on 28th February, 2000, and the Union has proposed 1st March, 2000 as the effective date of the incoming collective agreement and for a duration of two years, while the Company has urged the Court to reject the demand in view of the fact that the outgoing collective agreement is still in force and there was no need to enter into another one.",
            "\tThe Union demands the effective date with retrospective effect from 1st March, 2000, but the Company has opposed the demand on the ground that it has no funds to implement it. The demand for retrospective effect of an award cannot be claimed as a matter of right because the fixation of an effective date from which an award should operate is discretionary. It can be conceded only in exceptional circumstances, such as extreme hardship due to very low scale of pay, e.t.c. In any case, there can be no retrospective effect for any period prior to the date on which the proposals for negotiation were first made, and in this case we find that they were made for the first time on 27th March, 2000. Then again, when admittedly the management of the Company has granted increases since the commencement of the dispute, the Court should be loath to order retrospective operation from an earlier date. Lastly, in granting retrospective effect of an award, the Court must take into account the impact of the financial burden on the paying capacity of the Company. On a consideration of all these circumstances",
            "\tI am of the view that the demand for retrospective effect of the collective agreement with effect from 1st March, 2000, is utterly untenable. Accordingly, I AWARD and ORDER that the effective date be 1st March, 2003, for a duration of two years.",

            "PRELIMINARY OBJECTION.",
            "This dispute was referred to the Court by the Minister for Labour on 14th May, 1998 in exercise of the powers vested in him by Section 8 of the Trade Disputes Act, Cap.234, Laws of  Kenya (which is hereinafter referred to as the Act). The said reference, together with the statutory certificates from the Minister himself and the Labour Commissioner under Section 14, subsection (9) (e) and (f) of the Act, were received by the Court on 20th May 1998, and the dispute was listed for mention on 11th January, 1998 when Mr. J.N. Namasake appeared for the Hospital but there was no appearance for the Union. In the circumstances, the case was listed for another mention on 17th June, 1998 when Messrs T. Murungi and L.W. Kariuki, who appeared for the Union and the Hospital respectively,were directed to submit or file their respective written memoranda or statements on or before 2nd and 21st July 1998, and the dispute was fixed fro hearing on 11th August, 1998. The Union submitted their memorandum on 3rd August 1998, but the Hospital did not file their statement as directed. Consequently, the matter was adjourned on several occasions by mutual agreement of the parties. On 25th February 1999, the Hospital raised a Preliminary Objection challenging the maintainability and validity of this dispute on the ground that, pursuant to her individual or personal contract of service with them (Hospital), Mrs. Martha Wanjiru Karuithi (who is hereinafter called the grievant) was at the time of her termination serving in a superior or managerial position, and, therefore, she was excluded from Union representation as she was neither an “employee” nor did her alleged grievance constitute a “ trade dispute” as defined under Section 2 of the Act. It was alleged that, at the time of  her termination of service on 5th September, 1994 on account of disobedience of lawful orders, the grievant was earning a gross salary of Kshs.11,330/= per month, which was well above the highest paid long serving unionisable employee in the Hospital, plus a free three-roomed and self-contained house. The Union filed their reply thereto on 9th April 1999, in which they contended that the grievant was a bona fide member of the Union, and, therefore, urged the Court to overrule the Preliminary Objection and proceed to consider the dispute on its own merits.",
            "The Preliminary Objection was heard on 7th May, 23rd June and 29th July, 1999.",
            "The case of the Hospital was that the grievant was employed by them as a Cateress on part-time basis on 12th September, 1979 at a salary of Kshs.800/= per month; and in accordance with the terms and conditions of her service, she was entitled to an annual increment in July each year whereas the unionisable employees received their annual increment in April each year . On 1st November 1981, the grievant was engaged as such (Cateress) on full time basis at a monthly salary of Kshs.1,950/= against Kshs.890/=, plus Kshs.135/= house allowance, i.e. a total of Kshs.1,025/= per month, payable to the highest-paid long serving unionisable employee in the Hospital. She was also provided with a three-roomed and self-contained house at the Hospital’s dispensary on Ronald Ngala Street, Nairobi. Furthermore, the grievant was subject to a probationary period of three(3) months and entitled to thirty(30) days annual leave while unionisable employees were subject to a probationary of two(2) months and entitled to twenty-five(25) days annual leave. In terms of Clauses 7 and 8 of her letter of appointment, the grievant was also required to abide by the Hospital’s Standing Orders applicable to managerial staff and not to disclose any secrets or confidential matters to anyone not authorized to receive them. Mr. Kariuki pointed out that in July 1990, the grievant’s salary was reviewed, and in addition she was henceforth awarded a car allowance of Kshs.2,000/= per month, which was exclusively enjoyed by the managerial staff.",
            "Mr. Kariuki submitted that the grievant was the overall in-charge of kitchen operations and her primary duties and responsibilities included, inter alia, ensuring that the patients were provided with good quality food as recommended by the doctors and dietician in accordance with the needs of each patient; allocation and supervision of duties in the department; participation in the recruitment of kitchen staff, allocation of duties to them, appraisal of their performance and maintaining staff discipline; preparing duty roster for subordinate staff; maintaining an accurate inventory of all Hospital equipment and crockery in the kitchen and wards, and had access to highly confidential medical records, etc. He submitted further that while in employment, the Hospital neither operated a check-off system in favour of the grievant, nor did the Union inform them (Hospital) that she was their(Union) member and that she was making her monthly membership contributions direct to their Head Office. In the circumstances, the grievant was, therefore, a member of the management staff, and as such she was subject to the terms and conditions of service which were stipulated in her personal contract of employment with the Hospital. Mr. Kariuki pointed out that the position of  a Cateress has never been listed or classified or incorporated in all the relevant parties’ collective agreements for the duration of her employment with the Hospital, particularly for the period 1993 to 1995, when the dispute arose and under active consideration by the Ministry of Labour, and that the parties have all along been cognisant of the fact that the grievant’s position was non-unionisable. After all, the Union did not raise the question of her termination of service at the Local Works Committee level as provided for in the parties’ Recognition Agreement because they knew that she was not their member.",
            "Mr. Kariuki contended further that, while the Hospital recognized the right and freedom of an individual or employee to join and associate with a trade union of his or her own choice, only unionisable employees are eligible so as to maintain industrial peace and harmony. Therefore, the Court should not allow itself to be used by unscrupulous and crafty employees and unions in seeking redress on non-existent and baseless grievances. In support of the foregoing, he relied on Cause No.60 of 1996, between the same parties in which I upheld the Preliminary Objection and rejected the demand by the Union as not maintainable. Mr. Kariuki also took issue with and strongly objected to the purported letter of appointment attached to the Union’s submission, Appendix C I, on the ground that the specimen signature of the then Hon. General Secretary to the Hospital Board, the late Dr. H.H. Kamdar, was different from the signature on the grievant’s letter of appointment (see Hospital’s Appendix R.IIB). Thus, the purported letter of appointment, Appendix C.I, was a forgery.",
            "Mr. Kariuki, therefore, prayed that the Preliminary Objection be upheld and the dispute be rejected as not properly before the Court and also not maintainable.",
            "In reply, Mr. Kombewa submitted that the grievant has been a bona fide member of the Union for more than 10 years as shown in her letter of appointment, Appendix C.I, and for this reason her post of Cateress, which was similar to that of Housekeeper or Dietician, fell in a unionisable grade. He contended that the grievant paid her membership contributions directly to the Union, and maintained that the parties’ recognition agreement, the Industrial Relations Charter and Section 80(1) of the Constitution of Kenya, accord full and inalienable freedom and right to the grievant to join and associate with a trade union of her own choice; and in the circumstances, the grievant was entitled to the membership of the Union and to seek redress in this Court. Mr. Kombewa pointed out that the enhanced salary of Kshs.11,330/= and other benefits which were accorded to the grievant were personal to her because of the heavy or higher responsibilities she handled, and that did not mean that she was enjoying similar terms and conditions of service which were accorded to the management staff as alleged by the Hospital. He stated that there was nothing confidential and sensitive about her position as a Cateress because what she was doing did not involve either decision-making or disciplinary matters. In any case, he said, the dispute has been processed through all the stages of industrial relations machinery and that it is late in the day for the Hospital to raise a Preliminary Objection to the dispute. Mr. Kombewa relied on Cause No.95 of 1986 between the Union and the Presbyterian Church of East Africa (P.C.E.A. Chogoria Hospital) in which the issue in dispute was the failure by the Hospital to institute a medical board to examine and recommend whether or not Mr. Gerald Murunge could be retired on medical grounds. He also objected to the production of the letter of appointment, Appendix R.I, which was attached to the submission of the Hospital in support of their Preliminary Objection on the ground that the issue had not been raised before and that the deceased, the late Dr. H.H. Kamdar, who signed it, would not be available to give evidence on it.",
            "Mr. Kombewa, therefore, urged the Court to find that the Preliminary Objection was baseless, and prayed that the same be rejected and the dispute be heard on its own merits.",
            "The question for consideration and determination in this matter is whether the grievant was employed in a position of management as alleged by the Hospital or whether she was a unionisable employee within the meaning of the definition given under Section 2 of the Act and for whom the Union could raise a trade dispute. Admittedly, the grievant was employed as a Cateress in September 1979; and, according to Mr. Kariuki for the Hospital, her terms and conditions of service were of a managerial cadre, while Mr. Kombewa for the Union contended that her terms and conditions of service were covered by the relevant collective agreements between the parties in force at the material time. On this score, both parties relied on Appendices C.I and R.I, re: Letters of Appointment, of their respective submissions; and, although the genuineness and authenticity of these letters were in dispute, the specific duties entrusted to the grievant were not stipulated therein; but it was only stated in both letters of appointment that she would perform the duties entrusted to her from time to time to the best of her ability. At the time of her termination on 5th September 1994, the grievant was earning a salary of Kshs.11,330/= per month, while an Artisan, with Government Trade Test Certificate, Grade I, under unionisable Job Group IX, earned Kshs.3,340/= per month. The organizational chart on the record, Appendix R V, shows that the grievant had 17 subordinate staff, i.e. I Head Cook, I Assistant Head Cook, 6 Cooks, 4 Kitchen Supervisors, 2 Stores Clerks and 3 Cleaners, to whom she allocated duties, oversaw their performance, disciplined them, etc. In their submission to the Investigator, the management of the Hospital had also maintained that the grievant “was not a member of the union and the contract of service was between her and the Hospital administration”. In other words, the grievant was a member of the management staff, and she was, therefore, subject to the terms and conditions of service which were stipulated in her personal contract of employment with the Hospital.",
            "In order to appreciate the rival contentions of the parties, it would be useful to reproduce the definitions of the words “employee” and “trade dispute” as given under Section 2 of the Act. The definitions are as hereunder:-",
            " ‘ “employee” means …………………………………..",
            "(a)    any person who has entered into or works under a contract with an employer, whether the contract is for manual labour, clerical work or otherwise, is expressed or implied, is entered into orally or in writing, and whether it is contract of service…………………… ……………………………..………………………………………………………………………………….,",
            "(b)  …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..’",
            "We are not concerned with the rest of the definition or meaning. ",
            "‘ “trade dispute” means a dispute or difference between employers and employees, or between employees and employees, or between employers and trade unions, or between trade unions and trade unions, connected with the employment or non-employment, or with the terms of employment, or with the conditions of labour, of any person and includes disputes regarding the dismissal or suspension of employees, the redundancy of employees, allocation of work or recognition agreements; and it also includes an apprehended trade dispute’.",
            "In my view, both “manual labour” and “clerical work”, in the sense that these terms are used here, connote that they are more or less routine work, not requiring any great amount of initiative, imagination, direction, control and supervision in discharging the same. Therefore, those employed in supervisory, administrative or managerial capacity are excluded from the scope of the definition of the word “employee”. Thus, it is the nature of the duties that are performed by an employee which determine his or her status as to whether he or she is an “employee” within the meaning assigned to it under Section 2 of the Act. It may also be relevant at this juncture to reproduce the meaning or definition of the word “employer” under Section 2 of the Employment Act, Cap.226 of the Laws of Kenya, which runs as follows:-",
            "‘ “Employer” means any person or public body or any firm or corporation or company, who or which has entered into a contract of service to employ an individual, and includes the agent, foreman, manager or factor of such person, public body, firm, corporation or company’.",
            "It was argued by Mr. Kariuki on behalf of the Hospital that the grievant was a person employed in a position of management, and her job was that of an officer having control over other employees, with power to make complaints against and discipline them in an administrative capacity. In my opinion, the words “a person employed in a position of management” do not imply that in order to fall within these words the person must be performing managerial duties or that any person who is himself or herself subject to overall supervision of a superior officer would not be covered by these words. Though there may be one person acting in general management or control of an establishment, there would be, in a large establishment like the Hospital in this case, several others who would be in management or control of particular departments of the establishment and are excluded from the provisions of the Act and the Industrial Relations Charter. An individual dispute between an employer and an employee does not, therefore, become a “trade dispute” as defined hereinabove merely because it has been sponsored by other employees or a Trade Union unless (a) there is a community of interest between the aggrieved employee and the body of manual or clerical employees, and (b) that the community of interest must exist at the time when the act of the employee giving rise to the dispute had taken place and should not have arisen at a later date. In any case, those sponsoring his or her cause must be in the same employment, in the same association or Trade Union and with the same class of rights. Mere sympathy for the aggrieved employee would not be sufficient.",
            "As I have stated hereinabove, it was the nature of the grievant’s duties which determined her status and not her designation. On careful perusal of the duties and functions of the grievant, I find no material to show that her terms and conditions of service were in any way unionisable; and no substantial counter-arguments were advanced by Mr. Kombewa on behalf of the Union on the point raised by Mr. Kariuki for the Hospital that the grievant was not a unionisable employee under the Act. She had 17 employees under her charge and her salary was higher than that of the highest-paid long serving Artisan, with Government Trade Test Certificate, Grade I, under unionisable Job Group IX. Furthermore, her terms and conditions of service were personal and exclusively applicable to her as a member of the managerial staff. There was also no community of interest between the grievant and the body of the unionisable employees who were composed of manual and clerical employees.",
            "With the foregoing discussion in view, I uphold the Preliminary Objection and reject the dispute as incompetent and not maintainable. Finally and needless to say, I must, in these circumstances, advise the grievant to collect her terminal benefits from the Hospital in accordance with the terms and conditions of her appointment, if she has not already done so.",

            "F.K. Waweru, Deputy Secretary General, for the Claimants (hereinafter called the Union.)",
            "L.W. Kariuki, Senior Executive Officer, F.K.E., for the Respondents (hereinafter called the Company.)",
            " A W A R D.",
            "The Company are a multinational limited liability concern whose main business is that of growing pineapples and processing the same for internal and external markets. The parties have a recognition agreement and have also entered into several collective agreements which regulate the terms and conditions of service of the unionisable employees in the plantation sector or section of the Company. The present dispute arose as a result of the dismissal of Mr. Simon Kimatu Malusi (hereinafter called the grievant) on 25th May 1993, allegedly for theft of four(4) new canvas trousers and one(1) knife, belonging to the Harvesting Department of the Company. ",
            "It was the case of the Union that the dismissal of the grievant was wrongful and prayed that he be paid all his terminal benefits and compensation for wrongful dismissal and loss of employment; while, on the other hand, the Company contended that their decision to dismiss the grievant was justified and urged the Court to uphold it.",
            "The parties met at their own level to resolve the matter but no amicable settlement was reached. On 29th March 1994, the Union reported a formal trade dispute to the Minister for Labour who accepted the dispute and appointed Mr. A.N. Kiarie of Thika Labour Office, in accordance with Section 7 of the Trade Disputes Act, Cap.234, Laws of Kenya (which is hereinafter referred to as the Act), to act as the Investigator. Consequently, in his report which was released to the parties on 30th May 1996, the Minister found, inter alia, that the dismissal of the grievant was unlawful because the said items which were found in his possession were lawfully issued to him and recorded. In the circumstances, the Minister recommended that the dismissal be reduced to normal termination of service and the grievant be paid all his terminal benefits in accordance with the parties’ collective agreement. He recommended further that the grievant be paid six months’ salary for wrongful dismissal. The Minister finally appealed to the parties to accept the recommendation as a basis of settlement of the dispute. The Union accepted the recommendation, but the Company rejected it on the ground that “it was totally biased and did not reflect the true position of the matter” (see Union Appendices I to 11 and Company Appendices V to IX). Hence this dispute for adjudication and determination.",
            "The Notification of Dispute, Form ‘A’, dated 24th August 1998, together with the statutory certificates from the Minister for Labour and the Labour Commissioner under Section 14, subsections(7) and (9)(e) and (f) of the Act, were received by the Court on 1st February, 1999. The Union submitted their memorandum on 30th March 1999, and the Company filed their reply statement thereto on 21st March, 2000. The dispute was intermittently stood over generally at the joint application of the parties to enable them explore the possibility of an amicable settlement, but their attempts failed, and accordingly the case was heard on 13th February, 2001.",
            "It is not in dispute that the grievant was employed by the Company as a general field worker on 7th November 1977 in the pineapple plantation at the rate of Kshs.1.05 per hour; and at the time of his dismissal on 25th May, 1993 for allegedly stealing the said Company property, he was earning Kshs.6.95 per hour.",
            "Mr. Waweru for the Union submitted that it was unbelievable for anyone to imagine or think that the grievant would have stolen the said worthiless items, considering that he had rendered to the Company sixteen (16) years of clean employment record. After all, he said, there was no evidence at all to show that the grievant had actually stolen the said items. He contended further that the same were lawfully issued to him and he had a right to keep them as his working tools. Mr. Waweru also strongly deprecated the conduct of the Company in carrying out, or authorizing, a search in the grievant’s house for the alleged stolen property in his absence. In the circumstances, he prayed as stated hereinabove, i.e., that the grievant be paid all his terminal benefits and compensation for wrongful dismissal and loss of employment.",
            "In his reply, Mr. Kariuki stated that on the night of 1st May 1993, a plantation store at Ndula caught fire and the security personnel, with the assistance of other employees, put it off. But, unfortunately, some employees, including the grievant, engaged in wanton looting of the property of the Company, e.g. protective clothing, knives, jembes, pangas, mattocks, shovels, etc. On the following day, an appeal was sent out to the employees at the camps to return or surrender all the items which were looted the previous day; and, as a result, some employees heeded the appeal by returning or surrendering the stolen items and no disciplinary action was taken against them. However, the grievant and three other employees, namely, Francis Lubesi, Josephat Kariuki and Kimili Kivungu Kathul, did not bother to return the stolen items in their possession. On 5th May 1993, a raid or search was carried out by the personnel in the security department in an effort to recover the stolen items; and during the raid or search, the grievant and his colleagues were found in possession of the said property of the Company, viz: canvas trousers and knives. On enquiry, the grievant did not give a satisfactory answer, but a lame excuse that he had been issued with the items for distribution to his gang. This excuse was untrue because, even if he was issued with the said items, the same would have been returned at the end of the working day. In the circumstances, the grievant and his three colleagues were summarily dismissed in accordance with the provisions of Clause 18(g) of the parties’ collective agreement in force at the material time. The Branch Secretary and the Chief Shop steward interceded on behalf of the grievant for the summary dismissal to be reduced to normal termination of service, but the Company rejected it.",
            "Mr. Kariuki, therefore, submitted that, in view of the expansive operations of the Company, highly elaborate security measures had been put in place to ensure that employees and outsiders or strangers did not steal the property of the Company. But the grievant took advantage of a calamity, i.e. burning down of the store, to steal the property of the Company; and, after being accorded or given an opportunity to return the same, he neglected or refused to do so. Hence his summary dismissal as aforestated. In the circumstances, Mr. Kariuki prayed that the dismissal of the grievant be upheld as justified.",
            "The grievant, who had served the Company for sixteen(16) years with admittedly a clean record, was summarily dismissed as aforestated under Clause 18(g) of the parties’ collective agreement, which states as follows:-",
            "“18.   DISMISSALS",
            "Any of the following matters shall be viewed as gross misconduct for which an employee shall be subject to instant dismissal.",
            "(a)             ………………………………………………………",
            "(b)             ………………………………………………………",
            "(c)             ………………………………………………………",

            "(f)               ………………………………………………………",
            "(g)             If an employee commits any criminal offence against or to the substantial detriment of the Company or Company’s property.",
            "(h)             …………………………………………………”",
            "The value of the said items was not given, but it would appear to me to be very insignificant. Mr. Waweru contended that the said items were lawfully issued to the grievant by the in-charge of the stores and he(grievant) had the right to keep them as his working tools. Mr. Kariuki did not controvert this assertion by producing the records, which were in possession of, or kept by, the Company, to show that the same were not issued to the grievant as alleged. Another point which was raised by Mr. Waweru was that the management of the Company carried out, or authorized, a search in the grievant’s house in his absence. This was also not denied or challenged by the Company. Therefore, in view of the lack of contrary evidence from the Company to show that the grievant was not actually issued with the said items, and their non-observance or violation of the principles of natural justice in conducting or authorizing the search in the grievant’s house in his absence, I find that the punishment of summary dismissal of the grievant for the alleged theft was wrongful, extreme, and harsh as it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence, if any. I am also of the view that the grievant could not have been unwise to risk his sixteen(16) years of clean employment record by stealing such very petty items. In my estimation, therefore, the punishment was repugnant to the notions of good conscience, equity and justice.",
            "In the result, and considering his past sixteen(16) years of clean employment record, I am of the considered opinion that the grievant is entitled to normal termination of service, with full terminal benefits and compensation for wrongful dismissal and loss of employment. Accordingly, I award and order that the summary dismissal of the grievant be reduced to normal termination of service and he be paid all his terminal benefits in terms of the parties’ collective agreement in force at the material time. In addition, the grievant be paid an equivalent of six(6) months salary for wrongful dismissal and loss of employment.",

Waweru, Advocate, who appeared for the parties respectively, were directed to submit or file their respective written memoranda or statements on or before 1st December, 2000 and 5th January 2001; and by mutual consent of the parties, the dispute was fixed for hearing to-day, i.e. 8th March, 2001. Mr. Maina for the Union submitted his memorandum on 1st December 2000, but Mr. Waweru for the Company neither filed his reply statement thereto nor has he appeared to-day, and the matter is, therefore, heard ex-parte.",
            "In his ex-parte submission, Mr. Wambua stated that the Company are a construction concern or undertaking and are, therefore, bound by the Regulation of Wages (Building Construction Industry) Order, Legal Notice No.70 of 1994. The four employees (hereinafter called the grievants) were engaged on 3rd April 1990, 16th October 1990, 16th January 1996 and 1st February 1991, at a daily rate of Kshs.100/=, Kshs.100/=, Kshs.80/= and Kshs.100/= respectively. The 1st, 2nd and 4th grievants were employed as masons while the 3rd grievant was engaged as a manual worker, and all were laid off or terminated on 19th September, 1997 allegedly on account of lack or reduction of work. At the time of their lay off or termination, the grievants were earning Kshs.200/=, Kshs.200/=, Kshs.90/= and Kshs.200/= per day respectively.",
            "Mr. Wambua submitted further that the grievants served the Company with clean employment records, but their services were terminated by the Company as aforestated without paying their redundancy benefits. He said that the parties attempted to settle the matter at their own level, but no settlement was reached due to the intransigent attitude of the Company. Consequently, the Union reported a formal trade dispute to the Minister for Labour, who accepted the dispute and appointed Mr. J.N. Ndiho of the Ministry of Labour Headquarters to act as the Investigator. In his subsequent report which was released to the parties on 31st January 2000, the Minister recommended that “the grievants be paid their redundancy benefits” in terms of the aforementioned Order; and in addition, “they should be paid 2 months salary as compensation for loss of employment”.",
            "The Minister finally appealed to the parties to accept the recommendation as a basis of settlement of the dispute (see App.I). The Union accepted the recommendation but it would appear that the Company rejected it. Hence this dispute for adjudication and determination.",

Muthanga, Executive Officer, F.K.E., appeared for the Club. The Personnel Manager of the Club, Mr. Philip Koech, was also present or in attendance. The dispute was fixed for hearing on 7th September 2000, and meanwhile, the Union were directed to submit their memorandum on or before 14th July 2000, and the Club were ordered to file their reply statement on or before 31st August 2000. The Union submitted their memorandum on 18th July, 2000, but the Club did not file any reply statement thereto as ordered hereinabove. On 1st September 2000, Mrs. M. Onyango, Executive Officer, F.K.E., for the Club requested for a another mention on 7th September 2000, instead of a hearing, on the ground that she had not received a copy of the memorandum submitted by the Union. The dispute was, however, listed for a further mention on 11th October 2000, when Messrs. Mwari and Muthanga appeared for the parties respectively. On this date, the case was rescheduled by mutual agreement for hearing on 30th January 2001, and meanwhile the Club were allowed to file their reply statement on or before 10th November 2000. They did not submit the same and no reasons were given for their default. On 30th January, 2001, Mrs. Onyango for the Club applied to withdraw from the case for lack of instructions. The application was granted, and the matter was heard ex-parte.",

            "Mr. Mucuha submitted that Messrs. Jackson Towett and Samuel Kiplang’at (who are hereinafter called the grievants) were employed by the Company as drivers in 1984 and 1986 respectively; and at the time of their termination on 3rd May 1996 for alleged absence from duty, the grievants, who had clean employment records and were shopstewards earning Kshs.3,600/= and Kshs.3,000/= per month respectively. He stated that the grievants’ work schedule was that they left the Head Office for field work on every 2nd day of each month and returned on every 27th day of the same month, and took a break between the 27th day of the current month and the 2nd day of the succeeding month. On 27th April 1996, he said, the grievants returned from their field work as usual and parked their vehicles at the Head Office’s yard. But before they took their break, they informed the Managing Director that their vehicles required service. On their return for duties on 2nd May 1996, the grievants found that the vehicles had not been serviced; and in the circumstances, they could not undertake or go for their field duties. When the Managing Director was reminded about the service of the vehicles, he advised them to go home and report to him the following day, i.e. on 3rd May 1996. The grievants reported on duty as directed, but on their return they were surprisingly served with disciplinary letters, requiring them to explain why they had absented themselves from duties. The grievants submitted their explanations but these were not accepted as satisfactory. Hence their termination from service as aforestated (see Apps. I(a) & (b) II(a) & (b) and III(a) & (b) ).",
            "The Union reported an informal trade dispute to the District Labour Officer, Industrial Area, Nairobi, and attempts to resolve the matter at that level failed because the Company refused or neglected to attend and did not even bother to send an apology for their absence (see App.IV). On 7th May 1996, the Union reported a formal trade dispute to the Minister for Labour in accordance with Section 4 of the Act. The Minister accepted the dispute and appointed Mr. J. Gatimu of Nairobi Labour Office to act as the Investigator. In his report which was released to the parties on 28th July 1997, the Minister recommended that both grievants “be paid their full terminal benefits and in addition 8 months compensation for loss of employment”. He(Minister) finally appealed to the parties to accept the recommendation as a basis of settlement of the dispute (see Apps V, VI & VII). It would appear that the Union accepted the recommendation, but the Company did not react thereto. Hence, this dispute for adjudication and determination.",
            "Mr. Mucuha, therefore, urged the Court to find that the termination of the grievants amounted to victimization for their trade union activities, unjustified and in bad faith, and prayed that they be paid all their terminal benefits and twelve(12) months’ compensation for loss of employment in accordance with the calculations shown in App.IX of the Union’s submission.",
            "The Company were absent during the entire proceedings of this case, and they did not even file any reply statement to the memorandum of the Union, despite having been notified to attend and file the same. They have also shown a recalcitrant attitude in the matter, and I find that the Union have proved their case to the hilt. In the circumstances, and as prayed for, the case is allowed ex-parte and the Company are directed to grant terminal benefits and compensation, less statutory deductions, to the grievants as shown below:-",

Parties were directed to file a schedule of payments indicating the amounts owing to the claimants and the same was confirmed by the court on 26th January, 2021 at Ksh.39, 807,518 but the claimants had added an extra month with an additional sum of Ksh.4, 722,314 which is unjust enrichment.",

There was no access to the premises to undertake such process as can be confirmed from the CCTV footages that shall be produced in evidence.",

            " In response, the judgement debtor filed grounds of objection dated 30/4/2021. The grounds of objections are as follows:-",
            "i.   That the appellate decree of this court dated 9/4/2019 set aside the decree of the subordinate court dated 20/8/2015 in Kehancha PMCC No. 127 of 2004 and substituted it with the awards herein. ",
            "ii.   That the appellate decree herein substituted the original decree of the subordinate court, which dismissed the respondent’s suit with costs and allowed the appellant’s suit. ",
            "iii.    That the only aspect of the decree in this appeal which can be executed lawfully to give effect to the decree of this appeal dated 9/4/2019 is the costs of this appeal that were awarded to the appellant, thus this court cannot execute the decree against the respondent to recover the principal sum, interest thereon and costs of the suit before the subordinate court. ",
            "iv.   Had the appellant taken out the instant proceedings against the respondent, to recover the taxed costs of this appeal, there would be no problem. ",
            "v.    In any event, the costs of the suit in the subordinate court were already assessed within the suit. Additionally, the costs of this appeal were taxed within this appeal, independent of and separately from the costs of the suit before the lower court and the orders made. ",
            "vi.  Thus, regarding the principal award, interest and costs of the suit in the subordinate court can only be executed therein. ",
            "vii. The warrant sought if granted, would be ultra vires the powers of this court and unlawful; that the instant Notice to Show Cause is fatally incompetent for want of jurisdiction and should be struck out with costs to the respondent. ",
            "The Notice to Show Cause was canvassed by way of written submissions. The judgement debtor filed its submissions dated 22/6/2021 on 23/6/2021 and reiterated its grounds of opposition in its submissions. In support of its case, it relied on the decision delivered in Kenya Wildlife Services & Another vs Douglas Opiyo Shem.  The Counsel did not furnish a copy of the same to this court to have the benefit of reading it. The said ruling is not available online, thus the court can only treat it as non - existent.",
            "The decree holder filed her submissions dated 3/8/2021 on 4/8/2021 and mainly hinged her arguments on the provisions of Order 42 of the Civil Procedure Rules which give the High Court powers to pass any decree and the court to which the appeal is preferred shall be dated, drawn up, sealed and signed as directed by rules 7,8,9, of Order 21.",
            "Further, the decree holder submitted that the respondent is confusing applications for execution in the High Court with those of the Court of Appeal; that in the latter, the procedure is provided for under Rule 57 of the Court of Appeal Rules which provides that judgements at the Court of Appeal are executed through the High Court but there is no similar provision that the judgements in the High Court are executed through the subordinate court. The decree holder urged the court to be guided by the principles set out in Section 1A of the Civil Procedure Act and decline the judgement debtor’s argument",
            "I have carefully considered the rival arguments by both parties. The single issue for determination is whether the Notice to Show Cause proceedings by the Decree Holder are regular. ",
            "The origin of this appeal was against the judgement and decree delivered by the trial court in Kehancha PMCC No. 137 of 2004 - Mary Anyango vs South Nyanza Sugar Co. Ltd wherein the suit filed by the plaintiff (now the decree holder) was dismissed with costs. By a judgement of this court delivered on 9/4/2019, the court awarded the decree holder an amount of Kshs. 99,160/= with interest at court rates from the date of filing the plaint and the costs of the suit as well as the appeal.",
            "The decree holder filed a notice to show cause dated 11/1/2021 seeking execution of a  total of Kshs. 412,585/=. The judgement debtor opposed those proceedings on grounds that this court has no jurisdiction to entertain the execution proceedings but instead, the execution thereof should be conducted in the subordinate court; that the only aspect of the decree which can be executed lawfully in this court is the costs on appeal but not the principal sum, interest and costs of the suit in the subordinate court.",
            "On the other hand, the decree holder contends that nothing stops this court from executing a decree which it has passed and relied on several provisions in the Civil Procedure Rules to advance her argument and in particular Order 42 Rule 32 which provides:-",
            "“The court to which the appeal is preferred shall have power to pass any decree and make any order which ought to have been passed or made and to pass or make such further or other decree or order as the case may require, and this power may be exercised by the court notwithstanding that the appeal is as to part only of the decree and may be exercised in favour of all or any of the respondents although such respondents may not have filed any appeal or cross-appeal.”",
            "Order 42 of the Civil Procedure Rules as a whole, provides for appeals filed in the appellate courts. Order 42 Rule 32 of the Rules as read together with Section 78 of the Civil Procedure Act, outlines the powers of the appellate court to exercise jurisdiction and to consider or pass any decree, order either in whole or in part in relation to the appeal filed before it. The term ‘decree’ used therein is not synonymous with the decree that is drawn up for execution purposes. Rather, it is a pronouncement made by the appellate court. I respectfully disagree with the interpretation of the said provision by the decree holder.",
            "As properly observed by the decree holder, whereas there are clear  provisions on the procedure of execution of decrees of the Court of Appeal, which are executed through the High Court, there is no similar provision as regards decrees passed by the High Court.  Generally, it is Order 22 of the Civil Procedure Rules that deals with execution of decrees and orders.  It does not specify whether they are decrees emanating from the High Court or the lower court. In absence of any specific procedure, what guides the court, is Order 22 of the Civil Procedure Rules because there can never be a vacuum in the law.",
            "When the High Court entered judgment for the appellant, it set aside the decision of the lower court. I do agree with the judgment debtor’s view that once the appeal was allowed and the decision of the trial court was replaced with this court’s judgment,t that became the decree of the subordinate court and it is that decree that will be executed against the judgment debtor.",
            "For the above reasons, I allow the objection. The Notice to Show Cause as filed is fatally incompetent and it is hereby struck out with costs to the judgment debtor.",

            "The application is supported by the affidavit of Michael King’ori Macharia who avers that there is judgement on admissions at Ksh. 1,192,544.95 and propose to settle the same by way of instalments of Ksh. 50,000 monthly from the date of the order and until paid in full. that pending such payments there be stay of execution.",

            "The claimant well aware of the pending application engaged Chador Auctioneers who on 19th August, 2021 proclaimed and took the respondent’s property. They produced Warrants of Attachment and Proclamation dated 6th August, 2021. They forcefully seized motor vehicle Registration number KBW 553G despite the matter pending in court. the warrants of attachment and proclamation had not been served upon the respondent and hence not given an opportunity to comply with the court decree.",
            "Mr Macharia also filed his Further Affidavit and avers that they have paid the claimant in instalments to demonstrate good faith and the amount due is Ksh. 1,013,528.03 in addition to costs of Ksh. 141,823.25 and not Ksh. 1,192,544.95 since the court awarded the total sum without taking into account the amounts already paid to the claimant.",

The execution process is lawful and with the authority of the court.",

            "1. James Etyang Karani (the Appellant) sued the Respondents before the Magistrates Court on 16 December 2019, alleging that the termination of his employment on 15 January 2008 was unfair and unlawful.",
            "2. When served with the Statement of Claim, the Respondents filed a Notice of Preliminary Objection contending:",

            "4. The Appellant was dissatisfied, and after securing leave, he filed a Memorandum of Appeal contending that:",
            "(i) The Learned Magistrate erred in both law and fact in failing to appreciate sufficiently or at all that the PO raised by the Respondents bore factual aspects calling for proof and was therefore not a true PO as envisaged under the law.",
            "(ii) The Learned Magistrate misdirected herself in finding that the letter of dismissal (dated) 15th January 2008 was final, yet from the pleadings, it is clear that the Claimant filed for appeal against his dismissal to the Public Service Commission that was later transferred to the National Police Service Commission, whose outcome has not been communicated to the Claimant to date.",
            "(iii) The Learned Magistrate erred in finding that the cause of action arose in 2008, yet the decision on the Claimant’s appeal by the National Police Service Commission was made and allegedly communicated to him via a letter ref NPSC/1/28/VOL. I (106) dated 2nd February 2017.",
            "(iv) The Learned Magistrate failed to appreciate the fact and the law that the course of action arose on 2nd February 2017, when the Respondents considered and rendered the decision on the appeal by the Claimant against his dismissal.",
            "(v) The Learned Magistrate erred in law and, in fact in failing to appreciate that the Respondents had infringed the Claimant’s fundamental right to fair labour relations, the right to fair administrative action and had further disregarded his legitimate expectation as enshrined under Article 47 of the Constitution of Kenya, the Commission on Administrative Actions Act, 2011 and the Fair Administrative Action Act (No. 4 of 2015).",

            "I have considerable sympathy for the reasoning in all the above cases, which leads me to the conclusion that the cause of action, in this case, did not arise after the conclusion of the criminal case against the respondents. The respondents had a clear cause of action against the employer when they received their letters of dismissal on 2nd October 2010. They had all the facts which had been placed before them in the disciplinary proceedings, and they could have filed legal proceedings if they felt aggrieved by that dismissal, but they did not.",
            "22. In David Ngugi Waweru v Attorney General & Ar (2017) eKLR, the Court of Appeal stated:",
            "We may ask the same question about the appellant in this case: when did he become entitled to complain or obtain a remedy in damages from his employer through the civil court? Was it at the time he received the letter of dismissal on 29th April 2004 or at the time he received the letter converting the dismissal to termination in the public interest on 13th July 2006 or after the decision of the JR court on 17th June 2009? The answer, we think, is the 29th April 2004. For it bears no logic for a cause of action to accrue, and then, instead of proceeding to court, the aggrieved party pursues an appellate disciplinary process that would take him outside clearly stated statutory limitation periods. The detour to the JR Court was a calculated risk.",
            "23. From the foregoing, it is this Court’s view that an appeal or an internal disciplinary process does not stop time from running unless there is estoppel from the employer within the context of section 39 of the Limitation of Actions Act.",
            "24. The Court, therefore, concludes that the Magistrate did not fall in error, either of law or fact, in finding that the cause of action was statute-barred.",

That he rose through the rank to the position of Police constable all this time working in the office of the President.",
            "2. On 18th August, 2016, the petitioner together with other police offices in the department of Traffic were subjected to a routine Vetting process that was held at Kunste Hotel Nakuru.",
            "3. That prior to the said vetting the Respondent had sent its DCIO to carry out investigation following the wealth declaration forms that the Petitioner and his colleagues had filed. That on the date of the vetting the commission raised concerns on his MPESA transactions which he explained.",
            "4. The Petitioner then proceeded with his work only to be informed on the 8th December, 2016 that he was removed from service and was required to hand over all items in his possession which he complied however that the Respondent did not furnish him with the findings informing their decision to enable him challenge the same.",
            "5. The petitioner avers that as much as the Respondent is mandated under section 7 of the National Police Service Commission Act to vet officers and affirm their suitability section 7(2) of the same Act mandates them to apply best practices while carrying out the vetting process and accord justice to the officer as provided for under  Rule 4(c).",
            "6. It was stated that the Respondent acted against its own regulation by failing to communicate the Petitioner’s removal first to him before making the same public as provided for under Regulation 25(6). The Petitioner averred that he was not accorded any chance to review the Commission’s decision as provided for under Regulation 33 for the reason that the Respondent did not furnish him with the findings of the commission to enable him seek for review.",
            "7. The Petitioner contends that the fact that he was not accorded an opportunity to review the Commission decision went against the express provisions of Article 47 and 50 of the Constitution and he insists that his rights were infringed upon.",
            "8. The Petitioner opined that he was unfairly terminated from services without being subjected to due process and prayed for judgment against the Respondent for; -",
            "a) A declaration that the petitioner’s Fundamental rights and freedoms have been violated",
            "b) An order directing the Respondents to release the vetting results of the petitioner forthwith.",

            "d) An order quashing the signal circulated by the Respondent on the 8th December, 2016 removing the Petitioner from service and requiring the petitioner to return his items/uniform of work.",
            "e) An order for reinstatement of the Petitioner to his post as a police constable of Kenya Police service as well as reinstatement of all his privileges including his salary",
            "f)  A declaration that there exists no material to fins the petitioner had failed vetting",
            "g) Compensation to the petitioner for violation of his fundamental rights and freedoms",
            "h) Damages for unlawful removal of the petitioner from service",
            "i)  Costs of the Petition",
            "j)  Any other relief that this Court may deem just to grant.",
            "9. The Respondent in opposition of the Petition filed a replying affidavit deposed upon by Joseph Vincent Onyango, the Respondent Chief Executive Officer, who averred that the Respondent is empowered under section 7 of the National Police Service Act and Regulation 4 of the National Police Service(Vetting) Regulations 2013 to vet its officers to ascertain their suitability.",
            "10.  The Respondent’s Affiant averred that the removal of the Petitioner was arrived at after the Respondent noted a disparity between his declared wealth and his wealth in his bank Accounts and M-pesa. The disparity according to the Respondent could not be explained satisfactorily considering that the Petitioner had a net salary of Kshs. 9,000. It is on that basis that the Respondent concluded that the Petitioner lacked financial probity and integrity and removed him from service.",
            "11.  The Respondent’s Affiant averred that the decision to Remove the Petitioner together with other officer was communicated to the Petitioner through the service channel. Subsequently he was removed from service and payroll however he was fraudulently reinstated back to the payroll which anomaly was discovered by the respondent in 2019 during the biometric verification to remove “ghost” workers and the Petitioner was now expunged from the payroll informing his filing of this Petition.",
            "12.  The Respondent’s Affiant contends that the Petitioner has not demonstrated how the Respondent has violated his right under the Constitution during the vetting exercise.",
            "13.  The Respondent’s affiant contended that they followed the procedural requirement provided for under the Act and the regulation in subjecting the Petitioner to the vetting exercise and did not at any point act against the law.",
            "14.  In response to the replying Affidavit, the Petitioner filed a further supplementary Affidavit on the 8th March, 2021 maintaining that he was not served with the vetting decision and that he kept on following with the Respondent on the reasons why he was ordered to surrender his uniform and service items when he was still earning salary. He then agreed that when his salary stopped he affirmed that the respondent had terminated his services and filed this case.",
            "15.  This Petition was canvassed by way of written submissions.",
            "Petitioner’s Submissions.",
            "16.  It was submitted for the petitioner on three issue; whether the Petitioner was served with the vetting decision, whether the petitioner’s rights to fair administrative action and fair hearing was violated by the Respondent and whether the Petitioner was removed from service by a competent panel on valid grounds following a fair procedure.",
            "17.  On the first issue it was submitted that the petitioner was never served with the decision of the Commission on the vetting process carried out to enable him seek for a review. It was argued that the Respondent merely alleged having forwarded the decision through the service channel vide a letter which was not attached to the Replying affidavit affirming that the Respondent did not serve the said decision upon him as provided for under regulation 25(6) of the National Police service vetting regulations.",
            "18.  It was further submitted that under Regulation 18(2) of the National Police service vetting regulations the Respondent is mandated to serve the petitioner with any complaint or any adverse information which they intend to rely on and the Petitioner was required to respond in written form to the complaint.  Also the fact that the Respondent breached its rules by failing to serve the Petitioner with the commissions’ decision to allow him file for review infringed on his right to fair administrative action as provided for under Article 47 of the Constitution of Kenya and cited the Court of Appeal case of County Assembly of Kisumu V Kisumu County Assembly Service Board and Others case No. 17 and 18 of 2015 (Ur).",
            "19.  It was also submitted that the person that signed the final document that recommended the petitioner’s removal from services never participated in the vetting exercise which according to the petitioner negated the basic requirements of the rules of natural justice.",
            "Respondent’s Submissions.",
            "20.  The Respondent submitted on two issues; whether the Petitioner’s rights to fair administrative action, fair hearing and fair labour practices were violated by the commission and whether the Petitioner is entitled to the Orders sought.",
            "21.  On the first issue it was submitted that the Petitioner challenged the fact that he was not served with the complaint against him when the vetting committee were basically relying on the documents which were supplied by the Petitioner in the vetting process therefore the allegation that there was a complaint raised outside the documents the petitioner filed is without any basis. In this the Respondent cited the case of  Veronica Leiro Simintoi and another V National Police service commission[2020] eklr where the Court held that;-",
            "“…As regards the complaint that the appellants were not made aware of the charges before the vetting, we find that nothing turns on this. Each of the appellants had been given a questionnaire to fill in before the vetting. They had also been asked to supply their Mpesa and Bank statements as well as their wealth declaration forms. The questions put to the two of them were based on what they themselves had presented to the vetting board. Being their own documents, they were best placed to explain them.”",
            "22.  The Respondent then submitted that the Petitioner was relieved of his duties since the commission established that there was a huge disparity between his declared wealth as per the forms filled by the Petitioner and his wealth according to the Bank statement and M-pesa transactions.",
            "23.  The Respondent maintained that the Petitioner was served with the decision of the commission in line with regulation 25 of the National Police service vetting regulations which decision informed the Petitioner action of surrendering his kits and service items and subsequently removed from service payroll. It was argued that, if the Petitioner was not aware of the Respondent’s decision then he would not have taken any action as he did.",
            "24.  It was then submitted that Regulation 33 of the National Police service vetting regulations provides for review of the commission decision within 7 days which review the Petitioner opted to forgo.",
            "25.  The Respondent argued that it did not in any way infringe on the Petitioner rights as enshrined under the Constitution of Kenya as the entire vetting exercise was carried out in accordance with the law. Additionally, that the Petitioner has not demonstrated how his rights were violated by the Respondent therefore the Petition is unfounded and ought to be dismissed with costs.",
            "26.   I have examined the evidence and submissions of the parties herein.  The issues for this court’s determination are as follows;",
            "1. Whether the petitioner was subjected to fair administrative process.",
            "2. Whether the petitioner’s rights under the constitution were infringed.",
            "3. Whether the petitioner is entitled to the remedies sought.",
            "FAIR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS",
            "27.   The petitioner has submitted that he was not subjected to a fair administrative process.  The petitioner submitted that after he was vetted, he was not served with the vetting results to enable him seek a review.",
            "28.  From the evidence submitted in court, the petitioner went through the vetting process but there is no evidence that he was served with the vetting decision.  The decision removing him from service was dated 6th December, 2016 but the petitioner indicates that he continued receiving his salary up to January 2019.  The petitioner annexed copies of the payslip as evidence.",
            "29.  The respondents aver that their decision was forwarded to Inspector General who forwarded the decision to the petitioner through a signal dated 8th December, 2016.  The respondents aver that the petitioner was served with the said decision and surrendered his kit and was removed from the service.",
            "30.  The respondents exhibited their decision dated 6th December, 2016.  There is no evidence exhibited by the respondent that they send the vetting results to the Inspector General of police.  There is a signal exhibited dated 8/12/2016 from the County Commander Laikipia from the County Police Commander Laikipia.  This signal is however not copied to the petitioner and there is no evidence that the petitioner was informed of the vetting results.",
            "31.   Other than there lacking evidence that the petitioner was sent the vetting results, the petitioner informed court that he remained on the payroll until January 2019 when his salary was abruptly stopped.",
            "32.  The petitioner exhibited his payslip up to the one of February 2019 which shows that he was still on the payroll and had never been removed.",
            "33.  If indeed the respondent had vetted out the petitioner, the duty to inform him of the results was important.  The need to inform the petitioner of the results is provided for under Regulation 25(6) of the National Police Service vetting Regulation Section 5(d) of the Fair Administration Action Act provides as follows;",
            "“5(d) Where the administrator proceeds to take the administrative action proposed in the notice- ",
            "(i)  give reasons for the decision of administrative action as taken; ",
            "(ii) issue a public notice specifying the internal mechanism available to the persons directly or indirectly affected by his or her action to appeal; and ",
            "(iii) specify the manner and period within the which such appeal shall be lodged.”",
            "34.  Section 6 (1) of Fair Administration Action Act also provides as follows;",
            "“6. (1) Every person materially or adversely affected by any administrative action has a right to be supplied with such information as may be necessary to facilitate his or her application for an appeal or review in accordance with section 5.”",
            "35.    The above provision of law indicate that there is need to give reason for any administration action to enable the employee room for appeal/review.",
            "36.   In the case of the petitioner, there was indeed no indication that the petitioner was given results of the vetting board.  As such, the respondent failed to adhere to the law in order to give the petitioner an opportunity to seek an appeal on review in the circumstance.  It is my finding that the respondent failed to give the petitioner a Fair Administrative Action and they denied him an opportunity to appeal their decision or seek a review.",
            "2. CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS",
            "37.   I have alluded to the fact that the petitioner was not given an opportunity to undergo a fair disciplinary process.  His right to seek an appeal was denied because he was not given the vetting results.  This was in contravention of Article 41 and 47 of the Constitution on Fair Labour Practices and a fair hearing.  The petitioner submitted that his rights were infringed under Article 41 and 47 of the constitution.  I agree with the petitioner that his rights under the constitution were flawed and I find that so.",
            "REMEDIES",
            "38.  Having found as above, and having established that the petitioner remained on the payroll until February 2019 I find that he was only terminated when his salary was stopped in March 2019 and I find he is entitled to be reinstated to the service from March 2019 without loss of remuneration and promotion to date.",
            "39. The respondents will also pay the petitioner an equivalent of kshs.2million as damages for unfair and unjustified dismissal.",
            "40.   The respondents will pay costs of this suit plus interest at court rates with effect from the date of this Judgment.",

            "JUDGMENT",
            "1. This is a suit by the Claimant against the Respondent alleging unfair suspension and subsequent termination. As a result, the Claimant prays for monetary compensation against the Respondent.",
            "2. The Respondent has opposed the matter. It is the Respondent’s position that the Claimant’s employment was regularly terminated on account of gross misconduct. Hence, the claim is frivolous and ought to be dismissed with costs to the Respondent.",
            "3. From the pleadings and other documents on record, the Claimant was employed by the Respondent on 18th June 2015. This was in the position of branch manager. The parties signed a contract of service dated the same day.",
            "4. Upon his appointment, the Claimant was posted to the Respondent’s Hola branch. This was by a letter dated 21st August 2015.",
            "5. The Claimant served at the branch in the position of branch manager until 30th May 2016 when he was suspended from duty following alleged financial irregularities at the branch. The letter of suspension of even date informed the Claimant that the suspension was to facilitate investigations into the improprieties aforesaid. Meanwhile, the Claimant was required to hand over the operations of the branch to one Wako Wario.",
            "6. On 2nd June 2016, the Respondent wrote to the Claimant requiring him to explain what the Respondent described as massive financial irregularities at the Respondent’s Hola branch. These alleged irregularities were supposedly executed under the Claimant’s watch as branch manager. They include alleged: failure to account for Ksh. 664,700/= withdrawn from the Respondent’s Kenya Commercial Bank loan account (KCB loan account); posting of payments to fictitious accounts; fraudulent imprest claims totaling approximately Ksh. 130,190/=; and presentation of fraudulent Local Purchase Orders (LPOs) totaling Ksh. 13,440/=. The particulars of the improprieties are as follows: -",
            "a) The Respondent, relying on a special audit of the Hola branch, asserted that some Ksh. 939,000/= had been withdrawn from its KCB loan account. This sum was apparently to be held at the Respondent’s cash Vault housed at its Hola branch from where it would be disbursed to loan applicants who had supply accounts with the Respondent. That however, at the time of the special audit, only Ksh. 274,300/= of the Ksh. 939,000 could be accounted for. The difference comprising of Ksh. 664,700/= was neither in the Vault nor had it been re-banked into the Respondent’s KCB loan account. Yet, there was no record relating to its disbursement. ",
            "b) The Respondent’s auditors asserted that the Claimant was in charge of the Vault where the loan fund was kept. However, he allegedly could not account for the whereabouts of the cash. That this failure placed responsibility for the loss of the cash on the Claimant.",
            "c) The report and RW1 further asserted that some Ksh. 376,000/= was paid out by the branch to unauthorized beneficiaries. That the purported recipients did not have supply or business accounts with the Respondent to justify their being paid by the Respondent. ",
            "d) The Respondent further asserted that between October 2015 and May 2016 when the Claimant was suspended, the Hola branch raised imprest reimbursement claims totaling Ksh. 46,120/=. Yet, only two expenses totaling Ksh. 4,480/= could be authenticated by the audit. Thus, the Respondent allegedly lost Ksh. 41,640/= as a result of these claims. ",
            "e) It is the Respondent’s position that the Claimant had overall supervisory control over the imprest account. That he either deliberately or negligently sanctioned the false imprest claims.",
            "f)  With regard to fuel, the Respondent asserted that the Claimant presented LPO numbers 238180 and 238181 for fuel purchases allegedly for the Respondent’s vehicle registration number KBU 150T. Yet, the fuel was diverted to some other vehicles as motor vehicle registration KBU 150T was at the time in Nairobi.",
            "7. On 27th June 2016, the Claimant responded to the Respondent’s show cause letter aforesaid. He denied involvement in any financial impropriety at the workplace. He further asserted that all the impugned cash withdrawals were by Mr. Wako Wario and or Mr. Abdullahi Gobu Galano and or Mr. Edward Mwachinja Mwachoki. That of these three, the first two individuals had control of the branch cash Vault. As a result, only they could account for the lost funds.",
            "8. The Claimant denied any role in withdrawing and appropriating the money under inquiry. He contended that the KCB account had four signatories. That any two (2) of the four (4) signatories could sign withdrawal of cash documents and cause successful withdrawals. That he never signed any of the withdrawal documents for the monies in question.",
            "9. The Claimant further asserted that he was not in charge of the imprest account. This account was at all times allegedly controlled and run by Wako Wario and Abdullahi Gobu Galano. That these two processed the impugned imprest reimbursement claims.",
            "10.  The Claimant asserted that his only role in respect of the imprest account was to sign off the imprest reimbursement claims from the branch. That this would be after the accountant had presented receipts for supplies in support of the imprest reimbursement. The Claimant asserted that his role was to simply forward the claims to the Respondent’s internal audit department for verification and payments.",
            "11. With regard to the fuel claim, the Claimant conceded that indeed the fuel was purchased for vehicles other than the one whose details appear in the LPOs. However, he said that he purchased the fuel for use in two other vehicles in order to enable him travel to attend official business for the Respondent. This was because the Respondent’s official motor vehicle was not available for use at the time. That these transactions had the blessings of the branch accountant. The Claimant therefore denied any wrongdoing in this respect. However, he conceded that it was a mistake on his part to have entered wrong motor vehicle registration particulars in the LPOs.",
            "12.   The Respondent was not convinced by the Claimant’s response. Consequently, it invited the Claimant for a disciplinary session on 27th June 2016. This invite was by the Respondent’s letter to the Claimant dated 21st June 2016.",
            "13.  After the disciplinary session, the Respondent terminated the Claimant. This was by the Respondent’s letter to the Claimant dated 31st October 2016. The Respondent asserts that although the facts entitled it to summarily dismiss the Claimant, it nonetheless issued him with a normal termination.",
            "14.  The parties contest what transpired during the disciplinary session. On the part of the Claimant, he asserts that he was not supplied with documents to prepare for the trial. He argues that crucial documents such as the auditors’ report were withheld from him. That he was denied a chance to cross examine the Respondent’s witnesses and was not allowed to be accompanied by a co-employee of his choice during the disciplinary session as is stipulated in law. He described the session as an ambush.",
            "15. Yet, the Respondent’s witnesses assert that the session was conducted in compliance with the law. That the Claimant indeed cross-examined the Respondent’s witnesses. That the Claimant was not denied any documents that he wished to access. That he never demanded for the documents he now says he was denied.",
            "16.   It is as a result of the foregoing that the Claimant has presented the current claim. In the claim, the Claimant avers that he was wrongfully suspended and terminated. That the allegations by the Respondent against him were unsubstantiated and that he had effectively responded to them in his response to the Respondent’s show cause letter. Yet, his response was ignored and the termination unfairly handed down to him. Thus, he contends that the termination was without substantive grounds.",
            "17.   As indicated above, the Claimant asserted that he was also denied procedural fairness in the process leading to his termination.  He asserted that the suspension that preceded his termination was in contravention of articles 41 and 47 of the Constitution. He further asserts that he was not issued with notice prior to his termination. He was denied his right to be accompanied by a co-employee during the hearing and never cross examined the Respondent’s witnesses.",
            "18.  The Claimant also asserts that the Respondent did not pay him his terminal dues. The details of the dues which are set out in the Memorandum of Claim include salary for May and November 2016, three (3) months’ salary in lieu of notice, compensation for unutilized leave days and unremitted NSSF and NHIF dues.",
            "19.  In its defense, the Respondent disputes the Claimant’s claim. It asserts that the Claimant was terminated on justified grounds of fraudulent and or negligent misapplication of the Respondent’s funds under his watch. That the Claimant was in charge of the branch and therefore was entrusted with the proper running of the activities at the branch. That as the Claimant failed to do this resulting in the alleged loss of funds, there was a justifiable reason to terminate him.",
            "20.  In respect of procedure, as pointed out earlier, the Respondent asserts that it gave the Claimant a hearing and only terminated him after due process. That the Claimant’s terminal dues were processed but applied to offset part of what the Respondent had lost as a result of the events leading to the termination of the Claimant.",
            "21.  At the hearing of the case, the Claimant testified in support of his case. He did not call any other witness. On the other hand, the Respondent called two witnesses. The evidence adduced by the parties sets out their respective positions as set out above.",
            "22. At the close of the case, the parties filed submissions. In my judgment, I have considered the pleadings, exhibits produced, evidence adduced and submissions by the parties.",
            "23. The law on termination of contracts of service in Kenya is now largely governed by the Employment Act, 2007. Of significance in this respect are sections 41, 43, 44, 45 and 47 of the Act.",
            "24.   Section 41(1) of the Act provides as follows: -",
            "‘’Subject to section 42 (1), an employer shall, before terminating the employment of an employee, on the grounds of misconduct, poor performance or physical incapacity explain to the employee, in a language the employee understands, the reason for which the employer is considering termination and the employee shall be entitled to have another employee or a shop floor union representative of his choice present during this explanation.’’",
            "25. Section 43 provides as follows:",
            "“(1) In any claim arising out of termination of a contract, the employer shall be required to prove the reason or reasons for the termination, and where the employer fails to do so, the termination shall be deemed to have been unfair within the meaning of section 45. ",
            "(2) The reason or reasons for termination of a contract are the matters that the employer at the time of termination of the contract genuinely believed to exist, and which caused the employer to terminate the services of the employee.’’",
            "26.    Section 45 of the Act provides in part as follows: -",
            "“(1) No employer shall terminate the employment of an employee unfairly. ",
            "(2)  A termination of employment by an employer is unfair if the employer fails to prove: - ",
            "(a)  That the reason for the termination is valid; ",
            "(b) That the reason for the termination is a fair reason: ",
            "- Related to the employees conduct, capacity or   compatibility; or ",
            "-Based on the operational requirements of the employer; and",
            "-That the employment was terminated in accordance with fair procedure.’’",
            "27.  Section 47(5) of the Act stipulates as follows: -",
            "‘’For any complaint of unfair termination of employment or wrongful dismissal the burden of proving that an unfair termination of employment or wrongful dismissal has occurred shall rest on the employee, while the burden of ",
            "justifying the grounds for the termination of employment or wrongful dismissal shall rest on the employer.’’",
            "28.  And section 44 (4) (g) of the Act stipulates as follows: -",
            "‘’Any of the following matters may amount to gross misconduct so as to justify the summary dismissal of an employee for lawful cause, but the enumeration of such matters or the decision of an employer to dismiss an employee summarily under subsection (3) shall not preclude an employer or an employee from respectively alleging or disputing whether the facts giving rise to the same, or whether any other matters not mentioned in this section, constitute justifiable or lawful grounds for the dismissal if:-",
            "(g) An employee commits, or on reasonable and sufficient grounds is suspected of having committed, a criminal offence against or to the substantial detriment of his employer or his employer’s property.’’",
            "29. My understanding of these provisions of law is that they seek to substantially regulate termination of contracts of service particularly by an employer. First, an employer may not terminate an employee except for good cause. Some of the grounds that constitute good cause under section 41 of the Act are: poor performance; physical incapacity; and gross misconduct. Section 40 of the Act provides redundancy as the other substantive ground for termination but which is unrelated to those set out under section 41.",
            "30. But even where there exists substantive ground(s) to justify a termination, the law obligates the employer to observe certain procedural strictures to ensure the upholding of the broad principles of natural justice in processing the separation between him/her and the affected employee. The employer has to: provide the employee with details of the accusations against the employee; allow the employee an opportunity to respond to the charges; allow the employee to be accompanied by a shop steward or co-employee of his choice during the process; and finally provide the employee with a decision either terminating or saving the contract of service.",
            "31.  Where the employer fails to do the foregoing, the resultant termination is deemed unlawful. And in law, the burden of justifying the lawfulness of the termination both in terms of whether there was a substantive ground to terminate and whether procedure for release of the employee was adhered to lies with the employer.",
            "32.  Section 47(5) of the Employment Act sometimes presents a challenge regarding how to navigate the aspect of the burden of proof in addressing disputes arising from terminations. It does suggest two burdens: the employee has the burden of proving the unlawfulness of the termination; and the employer has the burden of justifying the termination.",
            "33.  The interpretation given to the section by courts is that all the employee needs to do in order to discharge the burden of proof on him/her is to place before the court prima facie evidence suggesting that a termination has occurred and that the said termination lacks a substantive justification and or is procedurally flawed. Once the employee makes a prima facie case, the burden of proof shifts onto the employer to justify the termination. In Josephine M. Ndungu & others v Plan International Inc [2019] eKLR, the court said this of the foregoing: -",
            "‘’Under section 47(5) of the Employment Act, the burden of proving unfair termination lies with the employee. The said burden is discharged once he establishes a prima facie case that, the termination did not fall within the four corners of the legal threshold set out by section 45 of the Act.’’",
            "34.   Indeed the overall design of the law is that the employer has the duty to provide evidence to establish the validity of the termination in terms of sections 43 and 45 of the Act absent which a presumption of fact arises in favour of the unlawfulness of the termination. Commenting on the interplay between sections 43 and 47(5) of the Employment Act, the Court of Appeal in Muthaiga Country Club v Kudheiha Workers [2017] eKLR said the following:",
            "‘’The grievants having denied, through their witness, the reasons given for their dismissal, discharged their obligation under Section 47(5) of the Act by laying the basis for their claim that an unfair termination of employment had occurred. This brought into play Section 43(1) and 47(5) of the Act that places the burden upon the appellant to prove the alleged reasons for termination of the grievants’ employment, and justify the grounds for the termination of the employment.’’",
            "I will come back to this question regarding the burden of proof later on in this judgment.",
            "35. In terms of section 43 of the Employment Act, an employer will be deemed to have a substantive justification for terminating a contract of service if he/she genuinely believed that the matters that informed the decision to terminate existed at the time the decision was taken. In other words, it is not a requirement of the law that the substantive ground informing the decision to terminate must in fact be in existence. All that is required is for the employer to have a reasonable basis for genuinely believing that the ground exists even if it later turns out that it, in fact, did not. In my view, what the law is concerned with here is whether the circumstances surrounding the decision to terminate would justify a reasonable man on the street, standing in the same position as the employer, to reach a similar decision as him/her regarding the termination.",
            "36. Commenting on this question, the Court of Appeal in Kenya Revenue Authority v Reuwel Waithaka Gitahi & 2 others [2019] eKLR said as follows: -",
            "‘’The standard of proof is on a balance of probability, not beyond reasonable doubt, and all the employer is required to prove are the reasons that it “genuinely believed to exist,” causing it to terminate the employee’s services. That is a partly subjective test.’’",
            "The court, relying on an extract from Halsbury's Laws of England went further to comment as follows: -",
            "“...In adjudicating on the reasonableness of the employer's conduct, an employment tribunal must not simply substitute its own views for those of the employer and decide whether it would have dismissed on those facts; it must make a wider inquiry to determine whether a reasonable employer could have decided to dismiss on those facts. The basis of this approach (the range of reasonable responses test) is that in many cases there is a band of reasonable responses to the employee's conduct within which one employer might reasonably take one view and another quite reasonably take another; the function of a tribunal as an industrial jury is to determine whether in the particular circumstances of each case the decision to dismiss the employee fell within the band of reasonable responses which a reasonable employer might have adopted . If the dismissal falls within the band, the dismissal is fair; but if the dismissal falls outside the band, it is unfair.”",
            "37.  Under section 44 of the Act, one of the grounds that would justify the finding of gross misconduct against an employee is the commission or suspicion of commission by an employee of a crime against the property or person of the employer. In relation to this ground and as has been rightly pointed out by counsel for the Respondent, it does not require the employer to have watertight evidence of the alleged criminal transgression for the ground to arise. All that is required is for the employer to have justifiable and compelling grounds to suspect that the affected employee has engaged in acts that are criminal in nature and which affect the property or person of the employer.",
            "38.   Commenting on the parameters of section 44(4) (g), in Thomas Sila Nzivo v Bamburi Cement Limited [2014] eKLR, the court observed as follows: -",
            "‘’ The Respondent had reasonable and sufficient grounds to suspect the Claimant of having acted to the substantial detriment of the Respondent and its property, and was justified in summarily dismissing the Claimant under Section 44 [4] [g] of the Employment Act 2007. The Employer was not required to have conclusive proof of the Claimant’s involvement; it was only expected to have reasonable and sufficient grounds. The physical audit, the discovery that no oil was available even as the Claimant protested he received such oil……….all gave the Respondent reasonable and sufficient grounds to act against the Claimant.’’",
            "39. In the current case, the question I ask is whether the Respondent’s purported substantive grounds for terminating the Claimant fit within the meaning of provisions of the Employment Act aforesaid. From the evidence adduced by the Respondent’s witnesses, the Respondent lost Ksh. 664,700/= which had been withdrawn from its loan account and kept in the Respondent’s cash Vault. At the time of this loss, the Claimant was in charge of the branch where the funds were kept.",
            "40. In his evidence, the Claimant denied involvement in the loss. The Claimant explained that the cash Vault was under the custody of Wario Wako and Abdullahi Gobu Galano. That it is these individuals who were in charge of these funds and only they can explain their loss. The Claimant further asserted that from the bank statements, it was Mr Abdullahi Gabo who did most of the questionable withdrawals from the Respondent’s KCB loan account.",
            "41.  It was the Claimant’s case that the Hola branch of the Respondent’s KCB loan account had four (4) authorized signatories and that transactions on it required only two (2) of the four (4) signatories. That all withdrawals were without his approval as he never signed withdrawal documents for the funds.",
            "42. In response, the Respondent’s witnesses stated that as the branch manager of Hola branch, the Claimant had overall supervisory control over the Respondent’s assets at the branch including the funds that were lost. That as the head of the branch, the Claimant was the principal signatory to the Respondent’s Hola branch bank accounts. That if the Claimant did not sanction the misapplication of the funds, he negligently permitted the loss by failing to discharge his supervisory mandate as the branch head.",
            "43.  Further, the Respondent’s witnesses testified that the audit disclosed that some cash had been remitted to accounts of individuals who had no business relation with the Respondent. That as head of the branch, the Claimant ought to have flagged these malpractices. That this evidence provided further details of financial irregularities at the branch under the Claimant’s watch.",
            "44.  In cross examination, the Claimant said that he never noticed the loss of the funds in issue as somehow, the Respondent’s branch finance records always balanced every time account reconciliations were undertaken by the Claimant and other staff at the branch. That he only realized the loss when the auditors pointed it out after the special audit.",
            "45. In a nutshell, this evidence is an admission by the Claimant that the Respondent lost the money in question only that the Claimant was not involved. The court finds the account given by the Claimant quite startling. As the branch head of the Hola branch, it surely must have been clear to the Claimant that the said branch was under his watch. That he was to ensure the sound management of the branch. Therefore, to attempt to steer clear of mismanagement of the Respondent’s finances at the branch by other employees allegedly on the ground that he was not in charge of the finances is to abdicate his role as head of the branch. This is particularly so because even though the branch account signatories may have been four (4), the Claimant was the principal signatory to them. Thus, he was reasonably expected to oversee what was going on with respect to the said accounts.",
            "46. The same argument applies to the irregular imprest claims. The Claimant asserted in evidence that one Abdullahi Gabo and one Wario Wako were in charge of this account. That they would raise the imprest reimbursement claims and all that the Claimant would do is to sign them off to the internal audit department for settlement. In other words, the Claimant by this evidence admits that he was fairly reckless in the manner he handled this account. By his actions, the Claimant simply failed to ensure financial probity at the branch by failing to ensure that the imprest account was properly managed at the branch.",
            "47. What is more is that RW1 confirmed that although claims for imprest refund for office items like water and milk had been lodged, the auditors confirmed that the branch did not have these items during the period of the audit. That during this period, the branch could neither provide water nor tea yet these items had been presented as purchased. This evidence further demonstrates that the Claimant was either complicit to the irregular financial dealings regarding imprest or he was just reckless about them.",
            "48.   The Respondent commissioned an internal audit which confirmed the losses aforesaid. It also confirmed that the losses happened under the watch of the Claimant. The Claimant did not deny that he was the branch manager of Hola when these activities took place. So what was his role as branch manager, if he could not oversee the overall wellness of the branch by ensuring that its finances were not misapplied?",
            "49. It is the audit report aforesaid that the Respondent acted on to suspend the Claimant, subject him to a disciplinary session and ultimately terminate him. I think that this events and the audit report provided the Respondent with a credible basis to genuinely believe that the Claimant had engaged in financial impropriety at the branch. This provided a sound ground to terminate the Claimant in terms of sections 43 (2) and 44(4) (g) of the Employment Act. I therefore find that the Respondent has proved this ground to the standard contemplated in law.",
            "50. But even if I were wrong on the foregoing, there was also the issue of the Claimant fueling vehicles that were not the Respondent’s but knowingly inserting in the LPOs the registration number of the Respondent’s vehicle. The Claimant says he did this because he needed to go on official duty but the official car for this purpose was not available at the time. Apparently, the actions by the Claimant to fuel private vehicles using the Respondent’s funds disguised as fuel expended on the Respondent’s vehicle were unknown to and had no approval of the Respondent.",
            "51.   One must wonder what informed the Claimant’s decision to deliberately insert the wrong vehicle registration details in the LPOs. Was the Claimant not just trying to beat the system through this action? Would a reasonable man on the street hold the view that the Respondent’s management were wrong to arrive at such conclusion?",
            "52.   It is noteworthy that the Claimant conceded in his response to the notice to show cause that this action was a mistake on his part. And through it, the Respondent perhaps lost over Ksh. 13,000/=. This to my mind provides a ground for gross misconduct which entitled the Respondent to terminate the Claimant.",
            "53.  I therefore find that the Respondent had valid reasons to terminate the Claimant. However, as I have observed earlier in the judgment, the law is not just concerned about ascertaining the validity of the reason for termination. It is also concerned with ensuring that the employer processes the separation in a manner that is procedurally fair to the Claimant. Indeed, this position has now been made clear by the court in several pronouncements. For instance, in National Bank of Kenya v Samuel Nguru Mutonya [2019] eKLR the Court of Appeal (referring to its previous decisions) said that in determining whether a decision by the employer to terminate is just and equitable, ‘’the adjudicating authority is enjoined to scrutinize the procedure adopted by the employer in reaching the decision to dismiss the employee.’’ I will therefore consider whether the Respondent met this second requirement.",
            "54.  Just as is the case with proving the validity of the reason for termination, section 45 of the Employment Act also requires the employer to prove that ‘’the employment was terminated in accordance with fair procedure’’. It is therefore not sufficient for purposes of determining the lawfulness of termination of employment for the employer to only show that he/she had valid reasons to support her decision. He/she must demonstrate that he/she complied with the procedural strictures set out under section 41 of the Act.",
            "55. In the current case, the Respondent asserts that it complied with the procedural requirements of the law in processing the Claimant’s termination. It supplied the Claimant with the formal charge and held a disciplinary session where the Claimant was given a chance to defend himself before a decision to terminate was taken.",
            "56. However, the Claimant asserts that he was denied access to documents that were critical to his defense. For instance, he mentions that he was not furnished with the audit report which was central to the dispute.",
            "57. The Claimant further asserts that he was denied a chance to cross examine the Respondent’s witnesses. He testified that he was neither informed of his right to have a colleague attend the proceedings with him nor was he allowed to come in with one.",
            "58. The Respondent’s witnesses dismissed this evidence by the Claimant. It was the Respondent’s evidence that the Claimant was informed to carry any documents relevant to the matter and he was free to request for whatever documents he may have wanted from the Respondent. He never did this.",
            "59. As mentioned earlier, the burden of proving the lawfulness of a termination lies with the employer. And this includes the employer demonstrating that he/she complied with the procedural dictates of section 41 of the Employment Act as read with sections 43 and 45 of the Act.",
            "60. From the very outset, the Respondent was on notice that part of the Claimant’s complaints in the matter was that the procedure leading to his termination was flawed. The Respondent was therefore on notice that it would be required to prove that it complied with the procedure set out in law in terminating the Claimant. It was therefore surprising that the Respondent opted to withhold from the court the minutes of the disciplinary committee proceedings. In cross examination, the Respondent’s witnesses confirmed that these minutes were not produced as exhibit.",
            "61.  How was the Respondent to prove that the Claimant was afforded a chance to attend the proceedings with a witness of his choice or that he was allowed a chance to cross examine witnesses or that he was supplied with the documents he is complaining about without producing the minutes of the disciplinary session that would ordinarily contain a record addressing such issues? And on what basis would the court declare that the Respondent has discharged the burden under sections 43 and 45 of the Employment Act in the absence of this record?",
            "62. The failure by the Respondent to file these minutes certainly deprives the court of evidence that the Respondent complied with the procedural strictures set out in law. Accordingly, I find that the Respondent has failed to prove that the procedure adopted to release the Claimant was fair.",
            "63.  Apart from attacking the decision to terminate his contract of service, the Claimant has also questioned the validity of the suspension that preceded it. He asserts that he was not allowed to show cause before the suspension was handed down to him. That this contravened his right to fair administrative action.",
            "64.  However, to the extent that the suspension was merely to allow for further investigations into the alleged financial irregularities, I cannot fault it. This was only a precursor to the disciplinary events that were to follow. I think that an employer is entitled to suspend an employee from duty in order to facilitate investigations on a matter that affects the relationship between the parties so long as the employee is eventually and within reasonable time afforded a chance to respond to whatever accusations that may have been raised against him/her.",
            "65. An administrative suspension is not intended to be punitive. It is merely a temporary but justified disruption of the contract of service pending finalization of the proposed investigations and or disciplinary process.",
            "66.  If we are to consider an administrative suspension as only temporarily disrupting and or suspending some of the obligations of the parties under a contract of service, then the critical question that arises is whether an employer is entitled to lawfully withhold the entire of an employee’s remuneration during the suspension period. The law is silent on this matter. However, it is to be understood that employment contracts are, like any other contract, also regulated by the general law on contracts.",
            "67. Under the general principles of the law of contract, remuneration certainly constitutes one of the fundamental terms in a contract of service. Consequently, breach of such term would result in the collapse of the contract. Indeed, Part IV of the Employment Act recognizes remuneration as a protected right of an employee.",
            "68.   Being a fundamental term of the contract of service and a protected right, an employer can only withhold the entire of an employee’s salary either with the consent of the employee or where the law permits it. For instance, section 63 of the Anti Corruption and Economic Crimes Act, 2003, permits suspension without pay of public officers who have been pronounced guilty of crimes under the Act but have elected to appeal the decisions. This is to remain until such appeals are determined.",
            "69. Therefore, it does appear to me that to unilaterally withhold the entire pay of an employee merely because his is on suspension would be in breach of the contract of service unless sanctioned by law. What appears to be a reasonable middle ground to ensure the contract remains alive during the disciplinary process is the practice of withholding a portion of the pay even as the other is released. I have made these comments in my decision because part of the claims by the Claimant relate to the period during which he was on suspension.",
            "70.  Going back to the question of whether the Respondent had substantive grounds to terminate the Claimant and whether the Respondent processed the separation procedurally, I have indicated that the Respondent has indeed proved the reasons for termination. However, there is evidence that the Respondent failed to prove that it accorded the Claimant procedural fairness during the process. Therefore, and on this basis, the termination is declared as unfair.",
            "71. The next question that the court must then consider is what remedies the Claimant is entitled to if at all. In the Memorandum of Claim, the Claimant has sought a number of reliefs. These include the following: -",
            "a) A declaration that his suspension was unfair and unlawful. The Claimant sought for orders that half of his salary and allowances withheld from June 2016 to October 2016 totaling Ksh 376,875 be paid.",
            "b) That he be paid damages for breach of contract and his constitutional rights following his suspension.",
            "c) That he be paid full salary for May 2016 and November 2016 totaling Ksh. 301,500/=.",
            "d) That he be paid three months’ salary in lieu of notice totaling Ksh. 452,250/=.",
            "e) That he be paid annual leave dues for one month quantified at Ksh. 150,750/=.",
            "f)  That he be paid NSSF and NHIF contributions of Ksh. 2,800/= and 23,800/= respectively.",
            "g) That he be paid damages for breach of contract and denial of the right to fair labour practice on account of his summary dismissal.",
            "h) That he be issued with Certificate of Service.",
            "i)  That he be paid costs of the Claim and interest.",
            "72.  As I have observed earlier on in the judgment, the Respondent had reasonable grounds to terminate the Claimant. The only reason why the termination has been declared unfair is because the Respondent did not prove that it upheld procedural fairness in processing the termination. However, it must be appreciated that notwithstanding the flaws in handling the disciplinary process, the Respondent complied with some of the procedural requirements demanded by law. For instance, it issued the Claimant with a notice to show cause, issued him with a formal charge sheet, convened a disciplinary session and finally rendered a decision.",
            "73.  I must ask whether it is equitable to appear to reward a Claimant who appears to have engaged in and or turned a blind eye to acts which directly contributed to his misfortune by ordering full compensation in his favour. The Court of Appeal in Kenya Power & Lighting Company Limited vs. Aggrey Lukorito Wasike [2017] eKLR reminds us that justice is a two way highway and the court must endeavour to render just decisions to employees in much the same way as it must to employers.",
            "74. Section 49 of the Employment Act which is the principle guide on the reliefs to be granted in cases of unfair termination obligates courts to take into account the extent, if any, to which an employee caused or contributed to the termination of his contract of service while addressing the kind and quantum of relief it will award in a cause. I keep this requirement in mind as I address the question of reliefs in this cause.",
            "75. The Claimant has prayed for several heads of damages as set out earlier in this judgment. Some of these reliefs relate to the period when the Claimant was under suspension.",
            "76.  It is to be noted that in the witness statement by RW2 which was adopted as part of RW2’s testimony in chief, he states that the Claimant’s termination was reduced to normal termination and his dues were worked out. These included his salary withheld from June 2016 to October 2016 (Ksh. 486,250/=), May 2016 net salary (Ksh. 94,553/=), and pay in lieu of notice equivalent to the Claimant’s two months’ pay (Ksh. 233,000/=). The RW1 and RW2 produced as exhibit the summary of workings of these terminal dues. It was the RW2’s evidence that these amounts were then applied to reduce the loss suffered by the Respondent as a result of the events at the Hola branch while it was under the eye of the Claimant.",
            "77.  It is noteworthy that this evidence was not challenged in cross examination of RW2.  The court therefore believes that the amount in paragraph 76 above was indeed credited to the Claimant but applied as suggested by RW2.",
            "78.  From the summary of the Claimant’s entitlements as presented by RW2, the Claimant was to get the balance of his monthly salary of Ksh. 94,553/= from June 2016 to October 2016. The difference from the Claimant’s gross salary of Ksh. 150,750/= had been proportionally released to him on monthly basis during the duration of the suspension. Indeed, although the Claimant had initially disputed this fact in his pleadings, I note that he indirectly admits these payments through his prayers in the Memorandum of Claim when he prays for an order that he be paid the remaining half of his salary for the period in question. ",
            "79.  Further, I note that the amounts covered the salary the Claimant stated was unpaid during the time he was on suspension.  Accordingly, I find that the Claimant continued to receive part of his salary while on suspension. I further find that the balance of such salary is as set out in the summary of his final dues as presented by RW2. The Claimant is therefore not entitled to pursue the claims for outstanding salary as he has purported to do in the Memorandum of Claim.",
            "80.  I note that the Respondent opted to reduce the Claimant’s termination from summary dismissal to normal termination and paid him two months’ salary in lieu of notice. I think that now that the Respondent opted to pay this item, it ought to have done so in line with the contract of service between the parties.",
            "81. Clause seven (7) of the  contract of service dated 18th June 2015 provides that either party who opts to terminate the contract pays the other damages equivalent to three (3) months basic salary. By virtue of this clause, the Respondent ought to have paid the Claimant three (3) and not two (2) months’ basic salary (Ksh. 233,500/=) as it did. Accordingly, I order that the Respondent pays the Claimant the deficit equivalent to Ksh. 116,500/= being equal to the Claimant’s one (1) month’s basic salary.",
            "82. Similarly, at the time of his termination (which the Respondent in its own evidence opted to treat as a normal release), the Claimant had rendered one (1) year of service to the Respondent. Having been engaged in June 2015, the Claimant was by virtue of section 28 of the Employment Act, due for his annual leave when he was terminated in October 2016. As this right was not taken and in view of the Respondent’s election to treat the termination as normal, the Claimant was entitled to be paid one (1) month’s salary as leave commutation. This was not done. I therefore award the Claimant Ksh. 150,750/= to cover his leave entitlement.",
            "83.  Having regard to the impugned conduct of the Claimant, I am minded to award him nominal damages equivalent to one (1) month’s gross salary of Ksh.150, 750/= as compensation against the Respondent’s failure to fully observe procedural strictures leading to the termination.",
            "84.  Section 51 of the Employment Act obligates every employer to issue a departing employee with a Certificate of Service. As was stated by Radido J in Transport Workers Union v African Safari Diani Adventure [2013] eKLR, this certificate is, by law, the right of every employee leaving employment irrespective of the circumstances under which he has left. If not for anything else, the instrument is critical to the employee because it signifies closure of the employment relation between the parties.",
            "85. However and as is provided under the law, the employer is not obligated to give the departing employee either a testimonial or a reference. All that the employer must include in the instrument is as provided for under section 51 aforesaid. It is thus ordered that the Respondent complies with this provision of law by issuing the Claimant with the requisite certificate.",
            "86. I decline to make any other awards prayed for by the Claimant in the Statement of Claim. In taking this position, I am guided by the principle that the award of reliefs under section 49 of the Employment Act is discretionary. However, this discretion must be exercised judiciously having regard to the guidelines that are inbuilt in the aforesaid section (see National Bank of Kenya v Anthony Njue John [2019] eKLR).",
            "87. The sum awarded in this judgment shall attract interest at court rates from the date of judgment till payment in full.",
            "88.   Having regard to the fact that each of the parties to the suit was at fault in some way in relation to the events resulting in this claim, I exercise my discretion to order that each party shall bear their own costs.",
            "89.  The award is subject to the applicable statutory deductions as required by section 49 of the Employment Act.",
            "Summary of the Award",
            "a) The termination of the Claimant’s contract of service is declared unfair only to the extent of the failure by the Respondent to prove that it afforded the Claimant procedural fairness in processing his release.",
            "b) Since the Respondent elected to convert the summary dismissal into a normal termination, it ought to have paid the Claimant salary in lieu of notice equivalent to three (3) months of the Claimant’s basic pay in terms of clause 7 of the letter of appointment dated 18th June 2016. The Respondent only paid Ksh. 233,000/= the equivalent of two (2) months. The Respondent is therefore to pay the Claimant an additional of Ksh. 116,500/= under this head being the equivalent of one month’s basic salary.",
            "c)  As the Claimant already accrued leave days for one year when he was terminated in October 2016, the Respondent to pay the Claimant Ksh. 150,750/= being equivalent to one month’s salary in lieu of leave.",
            "d) The Respondent to pay the Claimant Ksh. 150,750/= as nominal damages for failure to accord the Claimant procedural fairness in the process leading to his termination.",
            "e)  The Respondent to pay interest on the sums so awarded from the date of judgment till payment in full.",
            "f)  The award is subject to the applicable statutory deductions as required by section 49 of the Employment Act.",
            "g) The Respondent to issue the Claimant with a Certificate of Service.",
            "h) Each party to bear their costs of the Claim.",
            "i)  All other reliefs sought by the Claimant are hereby declined.",

            "JUDGMENT",
            "INTRODUCTION",
            "1.   Vide Originating Summons dated  21st October 2020,  the Plaintiffs herein have sought for the following Reliefs;",
            "i.  Declaration that the caveats registered in respect of the Property known as L.R No. 37/244/16, I.R Number 13375/16 is irregular and unlawful.",
            "ii.   The Chief Land Registrar is hereby ordered to remove the caveat registered in respect of L.R No. 37/244/16, I.R Number 13375/16 denoted in paragraph [ I] above.",
            "iii.  The Defendants are hereby restrained from interfering with the Property known as L.R No. 37/244/16, I.R Number 13375/16.",
            "iv.  The Honourable court do grant Damages to the Applicants in respect to the unlawful and illegal caveat registered in respect of the property known as L.R No. 37/244/16, I.R Number 13375/16 by the Defendants.",
            "v.   The Defendants do bear the costs of this Application.",
            "2.   The subject Originating Summons Application is based and/or anchored on the grounds contained at the foot thereof and same is  supported by the affidavit by the Plaintiffs herein on the 16th October 2020, and to which the Plaintiffs have attached and/or annexed various documents.",
            "3.   Following the filing and service of the Originating Summons, the Defendants herein duly entered appearance on the 19th November 2020, through the law firm of M/s Philip Muoka & Company Advocates. However, despite entering appearance, the Defendants failed and/or neglected to file a response to the Originating Summons.",
            "4.   Owing to the failure and/or neglect by the Defendants to file a Response to the Originating Summons, it is sufficient to note that the Originating Summons has thus not been opposed and the contents of the supporting affidavit thereto, thus remain uncontroverted.",
            "DEPOSITIONS BY THE PARTIES:",
            "THE PLAINTIFFS” CASE",
            "5.   The Plaintiffs herein has sworn a Joint Supporting Affidavit and in respect of which same have averred as hereunder:",
            "6.   The Suit Property namely, L.R No. 37/244/16, I.R Number 13375/16, belongs to and was registered in the name of Piara Sighn, now Deceased.",
            "7.   Besides, the Plaintiffs herein have further averred that during the life time of Piara Sighn now deceased, same entered into a Lease Agreement with the Defendants herein, who thus became tenants of the Deceased in the suit property.",
            "8.   It is further averred that despite the Defendants herein being tenants of the Deceased, the Defendants proceeded to and caused a caveat to be lodged and/or registered against the suit property, albeit without any reasonable cause and/or reasonable basis.",
            "9.   Be that as it may, the Plaintiffs have further averred that following the death of the Deceased, same sought for and obtained Grant of Letters of Administration, over and in respect of the Estate of the Deceased and thus the Plaintiffs are the duly constituted Administrators of estate of the Deceased.",
            "10. It was further averred that upon being  duly constituted as the Legal Administrators of the estate of the Deceased, the Plaintiffs herein engaged and/or otherwise retained an advocate to correspond with the Defendants, with a view to vacating and/or removing the unlawful caveat that was lodged against the title of the suit property.",
            "11. The Plaintiffs have further averred that following the various correspondence that were exchanged between their advocates and the Defendants herein, the Defendants finally agreed and/or conceded to withdraw the illegal caveats and in this regard, the Defendants instructed their advocate on record, who thereafter wrote to the Plaintiffs” advocates on the 29th October 2018,  forwarding a Notice of Withdrawal of caveat, duly executed by the Defendants.",
            "12. Nevertheless, the Plaintiffs have averred that the Notice of Withdrawal of caveat which was sent and/or forwarded under cover of the letter dated the 29th October 2018, was not in the prescribed form and neither was same executed in accordance with the law and in this regard, same was thereafter declined by the office of the Chief Registrar.",
            "13. It is further averred that subsequently, the plaintiffs advocate procured and obtained the requisite Notice of withdrawal of caveat and thereafter forwarded same to the Defendants through their advocate on record, for purposes of execution. For clarity, the Plaintiffs  have further averred that the Notice of withdrawal of caveat was duly executed by both the Defendants and thereafter returned to the Plaintiffs advocate.",
            "14. Similarly, the Plaintiffs have further averred that upon the receipt of the duly executed Notice of withdrawal of caveat, their advocate proceeded to and lodged same with the office of the Chief Registrar, for purposes of registration and further action.",
            "15. However, the Plaintiffs have further averred that despite the lodgment of the Notice of withdrawal of the caveat, the office of the Chief Land Registrar has failed to act on the lodged instruments and instead the Chief Land Registrar has since insisted that the Defendants herein must physically present themselves at the offices of the Chief Land Registrar, prior to and before the caveats can be vacated and/or discharged.",
            "16. Pursuant to the position taken by the Chief  Land Registrar, the Plaintiffs have averred that same were constrained to look for the Defendants who were previously  tenants in to the suit property, but who have since moved out of the suit property. In  this regard, the Plaintiffs have averred that they have not been able to procure the attendance of the Defendants at the offices of the Chief Registrar.",
            "17. In th premises, the Plaintiffs have thus averred that the caveats which were lodged by the Defendants, have thus remained undischarged to date. Consequently, the Title to and in respect of the suit Property, remains encumbered, todate.",
            "18. Owing to the foregoing, the Plaintiffs have therefore approached this honourable court to procure  and/or obtain an order to compel the Chief Land Legistrar to register the Notice of withdrawal dated the 20th November 2018 and or otherwise, discharge the offensive caveat without further and or undue delay.",
            "Defendants case",
            "19. It was pointed out that the Defendants herein, duly entered appearance , but however failed and/or neglected to file a Response to the Originating Summons.",
            "20. Owing to the failure by the Defendants to file a Replying Affidavit or Response, to the Originating Summons, the Originating Summons herein has thus remained unopposed and/ or better still, uncontroverted.",
            "Submissions",
            "21. The Subject matter came up for hearing on the 19th October 2021, on which day the honourable court issued directions, pertaining to and/or concerning the manner of disposal of the Originating Summons.",
            "22. It is worthy to note that the Honourable court directed that the Originating Summons be canvased and/or disposed of by way of written submissions, to be filed and exchanged by the parties within set timelines.",
            "23. Pursuant to and in line with the directions of the court issued on the 19th October 2021, the Plaintiffs herein proceeded to and filed written submissions in support of the Originating Summons.",
            "24. Nevertheless, the Defendants herein, who had only entered Appearance, but, had not filed any Response to the Originating Summons, however failed to file their submissions.",
            "Issues for determination",
            "25. Upon evaluating and/or appraising the Originating Summons and the Affidavit in Support thereof, as well as the written submissions filed by and/or on behalf of the Plaintiffs and in the absence of any opposition by the Defendants, I find that the following issues are germane for Determination;",
            "I.    Whether the Plaintiffs have laid a basis for the grant of the orders of lifting and or discharge of the caveat.",
            "II.   Whether the Plaintiffs are entitled to damages on the basis of the unlawful caveat or better still, whether Damages can be awarded on an Originating Summons:",
            "Analysis and determination",
            "Issue number 1",
            "26. The Plaintiffs herein have tendered and/or availed to the honourable court evidence to the effect that the suit property belonged to and/or was registered in the name of one Piara Sighn, now Deceased.",
            "27. On the other hand, the Plaintiffs have further adduced evidence that  following the Death of the Deceased, same were duly appointed as the Legal  Representatives of the estate of the Deceased. In this regard, the Plaintiffs are therefore authorized and/or mandated to commence and/or originate the subject proceedings, for and/or on behalf of the estate of the Deceased.",
            "28. Similarly, the Plaintiffs have also tendered evidence that the lodgment and registration of the caveat by and/or at the instance of the Defendants, was irregular and/or unlawful, insofar as the Defendants herein did not have any lawful claim and/or rights over the suit property, worthy of being protected vide a caveat.",
            "29. On the other hand, the Plaintiffs have further availed to the honourable court evidence pertaining to the engagement between themselves and the Defendants, culminating into the execution of a Notice of Withdrawal of the caveat. For clarity, the Notice of withdrawal of caveat, was meant to vacate and/or discharged the offensive caveat, which had been lodged by the Defendants.",
            "30. In view of the totality of the evidence, which has been reproduced hereinbefore, it is apparent that the lodgment and registration of the caveat was made without any lawful basis and in the absence of any legal claim by the Defendants.",
            "31. At any rate, it appears that the caveat under reference, was merely meant and/or calculated to prejudice the rights and/or interest of both the Deceased, as well as the Plaintiffs herein, so as to defeat their mandate and/ or Legal Rights over the suit property.",
            "32. Suffice it to say, that by virtue of being the Legal Representative of the Estate of the Deceased, the Plaintiffs herein are vested with absolute and exclusive rights to occupy, possess and use of the suit property without any limitations and restrictions, by any third-party subject only to the overriding interests. See Section 28 of the Land Registration Act,2012.",
            "33. In the premises, I find and hold that the caveat that was lodged and/or registered by the Defendants herein, against the Title of the suit property, was meant to fetter and/or otherwise interfere with the Plaintiffs rights and/or entitlement to the suit property. Consequently, the registration of the caveat was illegal and thus unlawful.",
            "34. In the premises, the Chief Land Registrar, be and is hereby ordered to discharge, rescind and/or vacate same forthwith.",
            "Issue number 2",
            "35. Other than the prayer for the Discharge and/or vacation of the caveat, lodged by and/or at the instance of the Defendants, the Plaintiffs have also sought for payment of Damages founded on the lodgment of the unlawful caveat.",
            "36. Despite praying for Damages, it is worthy to note that the Originating Summons herein was heard on the basis of Affidavit evidence and therefore the only evidence on record is the affidavit sworn by the Plaintiffs, which has not alluded to any injury and/or any loss suffered, to warrant an award of Damages.",
            "37. Suffice it to say, that save for instances like trespass to land, which are actionable per se and thus attract an award of Damages, even without proof of loss, in all other situations, it is incumbent upon the Plaintiff to put before the court evidence pertaining to the injury and the loss suffered, before an award of Damages can arise.",
            "38. However, in the instant case, the Plaintiffs have merely thrown the Originating Summons unto to face of the court and sought to be awarded Damages. The Plaintiffs have not cared to delineate what loss and/or injury has been suffered and neither have same pleaded the nature of Damages sought. For clarity, it is not clear whether the claim was General or Special Damages.",
            "39. I am afraid that no Damages can be awarded in the manner sought by and/or at the instance of the Plaintiffs. Clearly, some foundation ought to have been laid to enable the court to appreciate the basis upon which the Damages are being claimed. Without such basis, the prayer for Damages herein has been mounted in vacuum.",
            "40. Nevertheless, even assuming, that a foundation for award of Damages had been laid by the Plaintiffs, (which is not the case) I would still not be disposed to pronounce myself on the issues of Damages and or to award same, given that the subject suit has been commenced by way of Originating Summons, which does not envisage an award of Damages.",
            "41. In support of the foregoing observation, I beg to restate the finding and holding of the court in the case of Kenya Commercial Bank v Osebe (1982) eKLR, where the honourable court observed as hereunder;",
            "“Nevertheless, believing as I do that there was no power to award damages on this originating summons, I would allow the Bank’s appeal on that ground, with the result that the other questions raised, such as the measure of damages, do not now fall to be decided. I would allow this appeal, to the extent of setting aside the award of Kshs 180,000 damages and leave the respondent to pursue his remedy in this respect by suit, if so advised.”",
            "42. Based on the foregoing Decision, it is my considered view that if the Plaintiffs were keen to pursue the issues of Damages, whatever such Damages entail, then such a course ought to have been pursued in the ordinary manner of pleadings and particularly, by way of Plaint.",
            "43. In a nutshell, no Damages are awarded to the Plaintiffs.",
            "Final disposition",
            "44. Having reviewed the issues for determination, I come to the conclusion that the Originating Summons herein is merited and same is allowed in the manner following;",
            "i.    Declaration be and is hereby issued that the caveats registered in respect of the property known as L.R No. 37/244/16, I.R Number 13375/16 is Irregular and Unlawful.",
            "ii.   The Chief Land Registrar be and is hereby ordered to remove the caveat registered in respect of L.R No. 37/244/16, I.R Number 13375/16.",
            "iii.  The Defendants be and are hereby restrained from interfering with the property known as L.R No. 37/244/16, I.R Number 13375/16, in any manner, whatsoever.",
            "iv.  The claim for Damages be and is hereby Dismissed.",

            "RULING",
            "1. What is before this court for ruling is the Respondent’s/Applicant’s Notice of Motion application expressed to be brought under Order 24 Rules 3 (1) (2) and 9 of the Civil Procedure Rules, Sections, 1A,1B,3 and 3A of the Civil Procedure Act for orders: -",
            "(a)    Spent",
            "(b)    That The purported Appeal by the Appellants/Respondents dated the 3rd day of May, 2021 be struck out.",
            "(c)    That The costs of this application be borne by the Appellant/Respondent.",
            "The application is dated 26th January, 2021 and was filed in court on 27th January, 2021. ",
            "2. It is predicated on the grounds on its face and is supported by the affidavit of Ngugi Ndibii Wamutua, the Respondent/Applicant, sworn at Narok on 26th January, 2021.",
            "3. The application is opposed by the Appellants/Respondents vide the replying affidavit of Julius Tipatet Koros the 3rd Appellant/Respondent, sworn at Narok on 15th February, 2021 on his own behalf and on behalf of the 2nd Appellant/Respondent. ",
            "4. The application was canvassed by way of written submissions. In their submissions, the counsel for the Respondent/Applicant framed three issues for determination namely: -",
            "(i)     That the said appeal dated the 3rd May, 2019 has never been formally filed more than 1 (one) year down the line.",
            "(ii)    That the purported appeal has never been formally served as required in law, more than 1 (one) year down the line.",
            "(iii)   That the purported appeal has abated.",
            "5. In answer to the first issue, the counsel submitted that on 7th May, 2019 when the court allowed the Appellant’s/Respondent’s Notice of Motion application dated 3rd May, 2019 no time frame for filing a Memorandum of Appeal was indicated thus a fall back on the Civil Procedure Act would therefore mean that the same ought to have been filed within 30 days.  The counsel opined that the Memorandum of Appeal ought to have been filed by 7th June, 2019 and that to date no such appeal has ever been filed.",
            "6. The counsel termed the Memorandum of Appeal filed at the same time with the application for leave to appeal out of time as “a draft Memorandum of Appeal” since the orders sought in the application filed on 6th May, 2019 were granted on 7th May, 2019.  The counsel added that in any case, there were no prayers in the application for the draft Memorandum of Appeal to be deemed as properly filed.  The counsel pointed out no appeal has ever been filed almost 2 years down the line and hence it is illegal for the Appellants/Respondents to purport that they filed an appeal.",
            "7. On whether there is any appeal (Memorandum of Appeal) that was formally served upon the Respondent/Applicant, the counsel submitted that there was no appeal to be served since what was filed was a draft which is yet to be amended.",
            "8. On whether the appeal has abated, the counsel for the Applicant/Respondent submitted that the appeal (if there was any) the same has abated as against the 1st respondent who died more than a year and hence under Order 24 Rule 3 (1), (2) and 9 of the Civil Procedure Rules, the appeal against him has abated.",
            "9. On their part, the counsel for the Appellant/Respondent submitted that the Record of Appeal and the Memorandum of Appeal dated 3rd May, 2019 and filed in court on 6th May, 2019 were served upon the Respondent’s/Applicant’s counsel on 9th May, 2019.  The counsel added that the Supplementary Record of Appeal filed on the 6th July, 2020 was served upon the counsel for the Respondent/Applicant and in his view, the Record of Appeal, the Memorandum of Appeal as well as the Supplementary Record of Appeal were timeously filed and served thereby addressing satisfactorily the concerns raised by the Respondent/Applicant in his application.",
            "10.    It was also the counsel submission that notwithstanding the fact that the 1st Appellant/Respondent is deceased, the cause of action survives him in that the surviving Appellants/Respondents can continue with the appeal. ",
            "11.  The counsel citied Order 24 Rule 3 (1) of the Civil Procedure Rules which provides that: -",
            "“where one of two or more plaintiffs dies and the cause of action does not survive or continue to the surviving plaintiff or plaintiffs’ alone, or a sole plaintiff or sole surviving plaintiff dies and the cause of action survives or continues, the court, on an application made in that behalf, shall cause the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff to be made a party and shall proceed with the suit.”",
            "12.  Having read the application, the supporting and replying affidavit as well as the submissions filed by the counsel on record for the parties herein, I am of the view that the Respondent/Applicant is out to re-open a matter that has already been adjudicated upon by the court vide its ruling dated 10th June, 2020.  Whereas the court observed in its ruling that there was no Memorandum of Appeal, it nevertheless ordered the Appellants/Respondents to serve the record of appeal within 21 days from the date.",
            "13.  In the application before me, there is nothing to show that the Appellants/Respondents did not comply with the said direction and/or orders of the court.  In my view therefore for one to state otherwise would be splitting the hair.",
            "14.  If the Respondent/Applicant was dissatisfied with the ruling of the court, then he ought to have appealed against it.  Be that as it may, the Respondent/Applicant has not satisfied this court that notwithstanding the death of the 1st Appellant/Respondent, his co-appellants/Respondents cannot proceed with the appeal.",
            "15.  The upshot of the foregoing is that the application lacks merit and same is dismissed.  Costs of the application shall abide the outcome of the appeal.",

            "2.    The application is premised on the grounds on the face of it as well as the Supporting Affidavit sworn by Paul Gathuru Kariuki, the 1st Plaintiff, who deponed that him and the 2nd Plaintiff, his wife, are lawfully registered as owners of Land Reference No.15083/39 Muthaiga North Nairobi, the suit property, since 16th December 1991, when they obtained the title from Nyari House Limited and that they immediately took actual possession of the suit property and have remained in  possession of the land to date.",
            "3.    The 1st Plaintiff deponed that he discovered the suit property was registered in the name of the 1st Defendant when he conducted a search on the suit property on 22nd February 2021 and that the registration of the suit property in favour of the 1st Defendant was fraudulent and irregular as the alleged transfer and registration in favor of the 1st Defendant was unknown to them.",
            "4.    The 1st Plaintiff averred that the 1st Defendant was unknown to the Plaintiffs; that they have never sold the suit property nor signed a sale agreement with the 1st Defendant or any party; that the national identity cards, personal identification numbers and the photographic impressions used to transfer the suit property to the 1st Defendant do not belong to the Plaintiffs and that the original title has at all times been in their possession. According to the Plaintiffs, any documents lodged by the 1st Defendant to facilitate the registration of the suit property in his name were forged, fraudulent and constitute a criminal offence.",
            "5.    It was deponed by the 1st Plaintiff that the 2nd Defendant was negligent and reckless in registering the transfer in favor of the 1st Defendant by: registering the title in favour of the 1st Defendant while the original title was held by the Plaintiffs; failing to detect or suspect the fraud within reasonable time to avoid the fraudulent transfer; failing to take adequate precautions to avoid registering the said transfer; failing to cancel the transfer upon being notified that the same was fraudulent; failing to exercise due care, skill, diligence or competence in registering the said fraudulent transfer; and registering a clearly fraudulent transfer without caution or care.",
            "6.   The 1st Plaintiff stated that he is reasonably apprehensive that unless this court protects and preserves the suit property by way of an injunction, the 1st Defendant is likely to sell or deal with the property in a manner that will get the property further away from them and expose them to irreparable loss and damage; that the unlawful and fraudulent registration of the suit property in the 1st Defendant’s name denies the Plaintiffs the use and enjoyment of their investment and that the said transfer has unjustly taken away their lawful proprietary interest in the suit property.",
            "7.   The 1st Plaintiff stated that he is a state witness in a pending criminal case being Criminal Case No. 482 of 2012 Republic v John Gitau Kung’u and others in whih the accused persons have been charged with fraudulently selling the suit property to the 1st Defendant.  ",
            "8.   The 1st Defendant responded to the application through a Preliminary Objection dated 13th September 2021. The 1st Defendant averred that the application was res subjudice pursuant to Section 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules as there is a suit in respect of the same subject matter pending determination in Criminal Case No. 482 of 2012 Republic v John Gitau Kung’u and others, in which the 1st Defendant is a complainant; that changes in the registration status of the suit property would jeopardize the ongoing criminal case; and that the proceedings in this matter may lead to parallel decisions in multiple forums to the 1st Defendant’s detriment.",
            "9.    The 1st Defendant averred that the application is in bad faith because the Plaintiffs are privy to Criminal Case No. 482 of 2012 and as such should be struck out.",
            "Submissions",
            "10.  The parties canvassed the Notice of Motion dated 16th June 2021 and the Preliminary Objection dated 13th September 2021 via written submissions. The Plaintiffs’ Counsel relied on the case of Giella v Cassman Brown & Co. Ltd (1973) EA 358 where the Court of Appeal highlighted the principles to be satisfied in an application for an injunction.",
            "11.   The Plaintiffs’ advocate submitted that it was only fair and equitable that injunctive orders be granted to preserve the property pending hearing of the main suit; that if the order of injunction is not granted, the 1st Defendant is likely to transfer the property to a 3rd party, rendering this suit and the application nugatory and that the application and the facts set out in the supporting affidavit remain unchallenged and uncontroverted.",
            "12.  The Plaintiffs’ Counsel submitted that the 1st Defendant’s preliminary objection was a non-starter, untenable, misconceived and lacked any basis in law and that in accordance with Section 193A of the Criminal Procedure Code, a civil suit is not a bar to criminal proceedings. Counsel relied on the case of James Mutisya & 5 others v Alphayo Chimwanga Munala & 2 others [2021] eKLR where it was held as follows;",
            "“Firstly, that the fact that there exist civil proceedings emanating from the same subject matter is not a bar to institution and continuation of criminal proceedings. This is the dictate of Section 193 A of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 75) Laws of Kenya it provides thus:",
            "“Notwithstanding the provisions of any other written law the fact that any matter in issue in any criminal proceedings is also directly and substantially in issue in any pending civil proceedings shall not be a ground for any stay, prohibition or delay of the criminal proceedings...”",
            "As rightly submitted by the claimants criminal and civil proceedings can run concurrently. We agree with the Holding of the court in the case of Alfred Lumiti Lusiba -vs- Pethad Pank Shantilal & 2 others[2010] eKLR that:",
            "“....The conclusion that one can draw from Section 193 A of the Civil Procedure Code together with the decisions of the learned Judges in the aforementioned cases is that both civil and criminal jurisdiction can run parallel to each other and that neither can stand in the way of the other unless either of them is being employed to perpetuate ulterior motives or generally to abuse the due process of the court in whatever manner..”",
            "We could not agree more with the holding of the court in the Alfred Lumiti Lasiba case above. These are civil proceedings governed by civil procedure rules and also different evidential and legal standards. On the other hand, Criminal Case No. 2066/18 is governed by the Criminal Procedure Code with a different set of evidential standard and outcome. While the central component of both cases is guarantorship, the legal burden of proof is totality different in both cases. It cannot this be said that these proceedings an sub-judice the criminal proceedings. We thus do not find merit in the Notice of Preliminary Objection and the Application dated 23.1.2020.”",
            "13.  Counsel also relied on the case of Alfred Lumiti Lusiba vs Pethad Pank Shantilal & 2 others [2010] eKLR where the court held that:",
            "“The law is clear that the pendency of a civil suit is not a bar to criminal proceedings; it acknowledges the fact that the trial of the tortfeasor in a criminal prosecution need not be affected by the pending civil action against him. It is implied, therefore, that a civil suit cannot be stayed because of the prosecution of the tortfeasor for the obvious reason that the cause of action is neither rooted in the prosecution of the tortfeasor nor in his subsequent conviction… The conclusion that one can draw from Section 193A of the Criminal Procedure Code together with the decisions of the learned judges in aforementioned cases is that both civil and criminal jurisdictions can run parallel to each other and that neither can stand in the way of the other unless either of them is being employed to perpetuate ulterior motives or generally to abuse of the process of the court in whatever manner. The upshot of this discussion is that the learned magistrate misdirected herself on law by staying the civil case against the respondents on the ground that the case was based on a judgment which was a subject of an appeal that was pending for determination. I find merit in the appellant’s appeal and I hereby allow it. The appellant will also have the costs of the appeal.",
            "14.  The 1st Defendant’s advocate submitted that the Plaintiff’s case falls short under Section 6 of the Civil Procedure Act which sets out the sub judice rule; that the purpose of this rule is to prevent the filing of multiple suits between same parties or those claiming under the same subject matter and that they have satisfied the definition of a preliminary objection having raised a pure question of law.",
            "15.  Counsel for the 1st Defendant argued that the subject matter of this case is the same subject matter in Criminal Case No. 482 of 2012 in which the 1st Defendant is a complainant and that the 1st Defendant would be prejudiced if this matter was to proceed as it would jeopardize the criminal case. Counsel relied on the case of  Republic v Registrar of Societies-Kenya & 2 others ex-parte Moses Kirima and 2 others[2017] eKLR, which set out the principle of sub judice as follows:",
            "“Therefore for the principle to apply certain conditions precedent must be shown to exist: First, the matter in issue in the subsequent suit must also be directly and substantially in issue in the previously instituted suit; proceedings must be between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title; and such suit or proceeding must pending in the same or any other court having jurisdiction in Kenya to grant the relief claimed.”",
            "   Analysis and Determination",
            "16.  The issues for determination before this court are:",
            "a.  Whether this suit is sub judice.",
            "b.  Whether orders of temporary injunction should issue against the 1st Defendant pending hearing and determination of this suit.",
            "17.  The 1st Defendant raised a preliminary objection in which he sought that this suit be struck out as it contravenes the sub judice rule. The preliminary objection is based on the ground that this suit is sub judice Criminal Case No. 482 of 2012, Republic v John Gitau Kung’u and others, where the 1st Defendant is the complainant while the 1st Plaintiff is a state witness.",
            "18.  The definition of a preliminary objection was set out in the case of Mukisa Biscuits Manufacturing Co. Ltd –Versus- West End Distributers Limited [1969] E.A 696 as follows:",
            "“A Preliminary Objection raises point of law which is argued on the assumption that all facts pleaded by both parties are true. If argued, a Preliminary Objection, may dispose the suit without going to the merits of the application or matter. Where there are points of law and facts, the facts require proof of evidence.”",
            "19.  In Oraro v Mbaja (2005) KLR 141, Ojwang J. (as he then was) quoted the Mukisa Biscuit Case (Supra) and expressed himself thus:",
            "“A 'Preliminary Objection' correctly understood is now well defined as and declared to be a point of law which must not be blurred by factual details liable to be contested and in any event, to be proved through the process of evidence. Any assertion which claims to be a Preliminary Objection, yet it bears factual aspects calling for proof, or seeks to adduce evidence for its authentication is not, as a matter of legal principle, a true Preliminary Objection which the court should allow to proceed. Where a court needs to investigate facts, a matter cannot be raised as a preliminary point....",
            "Anything that purports to be a Preliminary Objection must not deal with disputed facts, and it must not itself derive its foundation from factual information which stands to be tested by normal rules of evidence...”",
            "20. It is not dispute that the suit property herein is a subject matter in Criminal Case No. 482 of 2012 Republic v John Gitau Kung’u and others, where the accused persons have been charged with fraudulently selling the suit property to the 1st Defendant. The sub judice rule is articulated in Section 6 of the Civil Procedure Act as follows:",
            "“No court shall proceed with the trial of any suit or proceeding in which the matter in issue is also directly and substantially in issue in a previously instituted suit or proceeding between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, where such suit or proceeding is pending in the same or any other court having jurisdiction in Kenya to grant the relief claimed.",
            "21.  Courts have established certain conditions that must exist for the principle of res sub-judice to apply. In the case of Republic vs. Registrar of Societies - Kenya & 2 Others Ex-Parte Moses Kirima & 2 Others [2017] eKLR the court held that:",
            "“…Therefore for the principle to apply certain conditions precedent must be shown to exist: First, the matter in issue in the subsequent suit must also be directly and substantially in issue in the previously instituted suit; proceedings must be between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title; and such suit or proceeding must be pending in the same or any other court having jurisdiction in Kenya to grant the relief claimed…”",
            "22.  To buttress this position, the court in Edward R. Ouko vs. Speaker of the National Assembly & 4 Others [2017] eKLR held as follows:",
            "“18. This then leads me to the issue whether the said principles apply to this case. For the doctrine to apply the following principles ought to be present:",
            "(1)  There must exist two or more suits filed consecutively.",
            "(2) The matter in issue in the suits or proceedings must be directly and substantially the same.",
            "(3) The parties in the suits or proceedings must be the same or must be parties under whom they or any of them claim and they must be litigating under the same title.",
            "(4) The suits must be pending in the same or any other court having jurisdiction in Kenya to grant the relief claimed.”",
            "23.  In the case of David Ndii & Others vs. Attorney General & Others, Nairobi High Court Petition No. 282 of 2020, the court held as follows:",
            "“The rationale behind this provision is that it is vexatious and oppressive for a claimant to sue concurrently in two Courts. Where there are two Courts faced with substantially the same question or issue, that question or issue should be determined in only one of those Courts, and the Court will, if necessary, stay one of the claims. Ordinarily, it is the second suit that will be stayed. (See Thames Launches Ltd v Trinity House Corporation (Deptford Strond) [1961] 1 All ER 26; Royal Bank of Scot-land Ltd v Citrusdal Investments Ltd [1971] 3 All ER 558) 509).",
            "Two obvious pre-requisites necessary to stay a suit under this provision of the law are one, the matter in issue in the subsequent suit must be ‘directly and substantially in issue’ in the previously instituted suit and, two, the parties in the two suits must be the same parties or are parties claiming under them or litigating under the same title.”",
            "24.  The law on concurrent civil and criminal proceedings is set out in Section 193 A of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 75:",
            "“Notwithstanding the provisions of any other written law, the fact that any matter in issue in any criminal proceedings is also directly or substantially in issue in any pending civil proceedings shall not be a ground for any stay, prohibition or delay of the criminal proceedings.”",
            "25.  The Court of Appeal in Commissioner of Police & The Director of Criminal Investigation Department & another v Kenya Commercial Bank Limited & 4 others [2013] eKLR stated that Section 193A should be exercised responsibly, lawfully and in good faith. The court stated as follows:",
            "“While the law (Section 193A of the Criminal Procedure Code) allows the concurrent litigation of civil and criminal proceedings arising from the same issues, and while it is the prerogative of the police to investigate crime, we reiterate that that power must be exercised responsibly, in accordance with the laws of the land and in good faith.”",
            "26. In Alfred Lumiti Lusiba v Pethad Ranik Shantilal & 2 others [2016] eKLR, Ngaah J opined as follows with respect to the applicability of Section 193 A of the Civil Procedure Act:",
            "“But even so, the viability of a cause of action in a civil claim does not necessarily stem from the conviction of a defendant in a criminal trial. Further still, the success or failure of a civil suit based on facts similar to those that a criminal prosecution is mounted does not necessarily depend on the conviction or acquittal of the defendant in the criminal trial; the outcome of a civil suit is independent from that of a criminal trial largely because the standard of proof required of a prosecutor in criminal prosecution is higher than that required of a claimant in a civil suit. To sustain a conviction, the prosecution must discharge the burden of proof beyond all reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offence with which he is charged. On the other hand, the claimant in a civil suit will only need to demonstrate on a balance of probability that the defendant is the tortfeasor and as a result of his tortious act or omission, the claimant suffered some sort of loss or damage that would warrant a remedy…The law is clear that the pendency of a civil suit is not a bar to criminal proceedings; it acknowledges the fact that the trial of the tortfeasor in a criminal prosecution need not be affected by the pending civil action against him. It is implied, therefore, that a civil suit cannot be stayed because of the prosecution of the tortfeasor for the obvious reason that the cause of action is neither rooted in the prosecution of the tortfeasor nor in his subsequent conviction…. the conclusion that one can draw from Section 193A of the Criminal Procedure Code together with the decisions of the learned judges in aforementioned cases is that both civil and criminal jurisdictions can run parallel to each other and that neither can stand in the way of the other unless either of them is being employed to perpetuate ulterior motives or generally to abuse of the process of the court in whatever manner.”",
            "27.  As stated in the above decisions, the pendency of a criminal suit is not a bar to civil proceedings, provided that such concurrent matters are filed and pursued lawfully and in good faith. The reading of the Plaint in this matter shows that the subject matter herein is in respect to ownership of the suit land, while the core issues in Criminal Case No. 482 of 2012 Republic v John Gitau Kung’u and others are the purported fraudulent acts of the accused persons with respect to the suit property. The outcomes of these two suits are independent of each other and unlikely to be parallel or contradictory, as the jurisdiction of the Criminal Court does not extend to nullification of title documents which have been acquired unlawfully.",
            "28. Considering that Section 193 A of the Criminal Procedure Code allows for concurrent litigation of civil and criminal proceedings arising from the same issues, this court finds that the 1st Defendant’s preliminary objection is unfounded.",
            "29.  The conditions for the grant of temporary injunctions are well established and set out in the locus classicus case of Giella vs. Cassman Brown (1973) EA 358 as follows:",
            "“The conditions for the grant of interlocutory injunction are now; I think, well settled in East Africa. First, an applicant must show a prima facie case with a probability of success. Secondly, an interlocutory injunction will not be normally granted unless the applicant might otherwise suffer irreparable injury which would not adequately be compensated by an award of damages. Thirdly, if the Court is in doubt, it will decide an application on the balance of convenience.”",
            "30. The first condition that the Plaintiffs herein must satisfy is that there is a prima facie case with a probability of success. In the case of Mrao vs. First American Bank of Kenya Limited & 2 Others (2003) KLR 125, “a prima facie case” was described as follows: -",
            "“A prima facie case in a civil application includes but is not confined to a “genuine and equitable case.” It is a case which, on the matter presented to the Court, a tribunal properly directing itself, will conclude that there exists a right which has apparently been infringed by the opposite party as to call for explanation or rebuttal from the latter.”",
            "31.  The second condition is that the applicant would suffer irreparable injury which cannot be adequately compensated by an award of damages. In Pius Kipchirchir Kogo versus Frank Kimeli Tenai (2018)eKLR the court defined ‘irreparable injury’ and ‘balance of convenience’ as follows:",
            "“irreparable injury means that the injury must be one that cannot be adequately compensated for in damages and that the existence of a prima facie case is not itself sufficient. The applicant should further show that irreparable injury will occur to him if the injunction is not granted and there is no other remedy open to him by which he will protect himself from the consequences of the apprehended injury…The meaning of balance of convenience in favor of the plaintiff is that if an injunction is not granted and the suit is ultimately decided in favor of the plaintiffs, the inconvenience caused to the plaintiff would be greater than that which would be caused to the defendants if an injunction is granted but the suit is ultimately dismissed. Although it is called balance of convenience it is really the balance of inconvenience and it is for the plaintiffs to show that the inconvenience caused to them would be greater than that which may be caused to the defendants. Should the inconvenience be equal, it is the plaintiffs who suffer. In other words, the plaintiffs have to show that the comparative mischief from the inconvenience which is likely to arise from withholding the injunction will be greater than which is likely to arise from granting it.”",
            "32.  The Plaintiffs case is that despite being the lawful owners and occupants of the suit property, their title was fraudulently transferred to the 1st Defendant. The Plaintiffs deponed that this fraud was effected through the negligence or recklessness of the 2nd Defendant in registering the title for LR No. 15083/39 in favour of the 1st Defendant.",
            "33.  The 1st Defendant has not denied the Plaintiffs’ assertion that they were the registered proprietors of the suit property, and that indeed the Plaintiffs have never transferred the suit property to him. Indeed, the fact that the 1st Defendant is a complainant in a criminal case in which he has alleged that the accused persons fraudulently sold to him the suit property is an admission that the Plaintiffs did not sell to him the suit property.",
            "34.  That being the case, it is the finding of this court that the Plaintiffs have established that they have a prima facie case with chances of success. Indeed, considering that the suit property has since been transferred in favour of the 1st Defendant, if the court declines to grant the Plaintiffs an order of temporary injunction, the 1st Defendant may deal with the suit property in a manner that could occasion the Plaintiffs irreparable injury that may not be compensated by way of damages.",
            "35.  Indeed, it is not disputed that it is the Plaintiffs who are in possession of the suit property. That being the case, the balance of convenience in leans towards the Plaintiffs. For those reasons, it is the finding of this court that the application dated 16th June, 2021 is meritorious. The application is allowed as follows:",
            "a.   A temporary injunction be and is hereby issued restraining the 1st Defendant, its agents, servants or any other persons claiming title through the 1st Defendant from selling, transferring, assigning, building, entering, charging or in any other way dealing with all that parcel of land known as Land Reference No.15083/39 Muthaiga North Nairobi pending the hearing and final determination of the suit.",

            "JUDGMENT",
            "Background",
            "1) BERNARD KIURU M’RIKURU (Appellant) was charged with defilement contrary to section 8(1) as read with section 8(2) of the Sexual Offences Act No. 3 of 2006 (the Act). The offence was allegedly committed on 14.12.2016 against SK a child aged 6 years.",
            "2) The prosecution called four (4) witnesses in support of the charges. PW1 the complainant stated that she was 7 years. She recalled that on 14.12.2016, her mother went to buy food and left her with her 3 years old brother. That they went and started playing outside the house of their neighbour Bernard and it was while there that Bernard took her into his one roomed house where he defiled her and only let her go after Mama Wanja found them and hit him on the head and took her home. Complainant’s mother JM was returning home when she heard Mama Wanja screaming that Bernard was killing the daughter of J. She found complainant in bed and she informed her that Bernard had defiled her. She said she knew Bernard who had been employed by her immediate neigbour Martin for about 1 year.  Complainant was examined on 16.12.2016 by Mary Kendi, a clinical officer who found that the hymen was broken and her labia was swollen from which she opined that complainant had been defiled. Shee tendered complainant’s P3 form as PEXH. 1. PC Njiru Charity Muthoni, the investigating officer received complainant’s report on 15.12.2016 and after investigations caused Appellant to be charged.",
            "3) Appellant confirmed complainant’s mother was his employer’s neighbour. He said that complainant’s mother had been his lover since her husband died and that she framed her after they differed.",
            "4) In a judgment dated 10.12.2018 the Appellant was convicted and sentenced to serve life imprisonment.",

            " (1) A person who commits an act which causes penetration with a child is guilty of an offence termed defilement.",
            " (2) A person who commits an offence of defilement with a child aged eleven years or less shall upon conviction be sentenced to imprisonment for life.",
            "8) It is trite that the age of a minor is a critical component of a defilement charge and that it is an element which must be proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. In Kaingu Kasomo vs. Republic Criminal Appeal No. 504 of 2010 the Court of Appeal stated as follows:",
            "“Age of the victim of sexual assault under the Sexual Offences Act is a critical component. It forms part of the charge which must be proved the same way as penetration in the cases of rape and defilement. It is therefore essential that the same be proved by credible evidence for the sentence to be imposed will be dependent on the age of the victim”.",
            "9) Proof of the age of a victim of defilement is crucial because the prescribed sentence is dependent on the age of victim. Dire consequences flow from proof of the offence of defilement. (See Hadson Ali Mwachongo vs Republic Criminal Appeal No. 65 of 2015 [2016] eKLR & Alfayo Gombe Okello vs. Republic Cr. App. No. 203 of 2009[2010] eKLR).",
            "10) Except for the complainant who said she was 7 years when she testified in 2018, her mother did not offer any useful information but the evidence contained in the P3 form assessed her age to be 6 years in 2016 when she was examined.  The Court of Appeal in Evans Wamalwa Simiyu vs R Criminal Appeal No. 118 of 2013 [2016] eKLR held as follows in a similar case:",
            " “As to whether the appellant’s age fell within 12 and 15 years of age, the evidence was rather obscure. Although the complainant testified that her age was twelve years, she did not explain the source of this information. The Complainant’s mother did not offer any useful evidence in this regard as she did not say anything about the complainant’s age. This leaves only the evidence of Dr. Mayende who indicated at Part C of the P3 form that the estimated age of the complainant was 12 years. We have anxiously considered the purport of this evidence since the Doctor does not appear to have carried out a specific scientific age assessment. Nevertheless, we do note that under part C of the P3 form the age required is estimated age and under the Children’s Act “age” where actual age is not known means apparent age. This means that in the Doctors opinion the apparent age of the complainant from his observation was 12 years. Thus, although the actual age of the minor complainant was not established, the apparent age was established as 12 years.”",
            "11)  From the foregoing, I find that the trial court correctly analysed the evidence and came to the conclusion that the complainant was below the age of 12 years.",
            "Penetration",
            "12) Section 2 of the Act defines penetration to entail: -",
            "“partial or complete insertion of a genital organ of a person into the genital organ of another person.” ",
            "13)  The P3 form PEXH. 1.  reveals that complainant had a broken hymen and her labia was swollen from which it was opined that there was penetration.  I am persuaded that the trial magistrate correctly found that penetration was proved.",
            "Identification of the assailant",
            "14) Appellant who was employed by complainant’s mother’s neighbour does not deny that he was well known to the complainant. Although Mama Wanja who allegedly found the Appellant in the act was not called as a witness, the Evidence Act, Chapter 80, Laws of Kenya provides at Section 143 THAT:",
            "“No particular number of witnesses shall in the absence of any provision of the law to the contrary be required for proof of any fact.”",
            "15) This position was restated in Julius Kalewa Mutunga vs Republic Criminal Appeal No. 31 of 2005, where the Court of Appeal held,",
            " “...As a general principle of law, whether a witness should be called by the prosecution is a matter within their discretion and an appeal court will not interfere with the exercise of that discretion unless, for example, it is shown that the prosecution was influenced by some oblique motive.”",
            "16) As a general rule of evidence embodied in Section 124 of the Evidence Act, an accused person shall not be liable to be convicted on the basis of the evidence of the victim unless such evidence is corroborated. The proviso to that section make an exception in sexual offences and provides as follows:",
            "“Provided that where in a criminal case involving a sexual offence the only evidence is that of the alleged victim of the offence, the court shall receive the evidence of the alleged victim and proceed to convict the accused person if, for reasons to be recorded in the proceedings, the court is satisfied that the alleged victim is telling the truth.”",
            "17)  The evidence on record reveals that the complainant identified the Appellant as the one who had defiled her. She knew him as he was a neighbor.  With this evidence, the learned trial magistrate ruled, a finding which I agree with that complainant was telling the truth as to the fact that it was Appellant that defiled her. ",
            "18) Turning to the issue of defense, Appellant was represented by counsel throughout the trial and his contention that the magnitude of the offence was not explained to him and that he was not able to plan well for his defence are rejected.",
            "19)  As to sentence, the Appellant argues that the sentence of life imprisonment was harsh, excessive and without due regard to the circumstances pertaining to the offence. There is a myriad of Court of Appeal decisions which hold that the provisions of the Sexual Offences Act must be interpreted so as not to take away the discretion of the court in sentencing. Some of those cases include Dismas Wafula Kilwake v Republic Criminal Appeal No. 129 of 2014 [2018] eKLR, Christopher Ochieng v R KSM Criminal Appeal No. 202 of [2018] eKLR 2011, Jared Koita Injiri v R KSM Criminal Appeal No. 93 of 2014 [2019] eKLR and Evans Wanjala Wanyonyi v Republic Criminal Appeal No. 312 of 2018 [2019] eKLR. The Court in Christopher Ochieng (supra) reduced a sentence of life imprisonment to 30 years for the defilement of an 8-year-old girl. In Jared Koita Injiri (supra) the Court revised an imprisonment of life downwards to 30 years for the defilement of a girl aged 9 years.",
            "20) Although the trial court indicated that it had considered the appellant’s mitigation, it seemed constrained by the mandatory minimum sentence provided in Section 8 (2) of the Sexual Offences Act. The aggravating factors in this case include the fact that the appellant was known to the minor he defiled and expected to protect. The fact that the minor was a child of tender years is also an aggravating factor. There is a need for society to eradicate such ghastly acts against children. I have weighed this against the fact that the appellant was a first offender. Taking all these into account and also bearing in mind the decisions of the Court of Appeal on comparative cases and the fact that the Appellant is over 75 years old, I set aside the sentence of life imprisonment and substitute thereof with a sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment to run from the date of the trial court’s judgment.",

            "RULING",
            "Background",
            "1.  Before this Court for determination is the Plaintiff’s Notice of Motion Application dated 1st of October 2021 seeking the following orders:",
            "a)   This Honourable Court be pleased to review and set aside the Ruling and orders of Justice Obaga dated 23rd September 2021 and in its place, an order be issued allowing the parties herein to file additional evidence to be used by the Court in assessment of mesne profits.",
            "b)   Costs of this Application be provided for.",
            "2.  The Application is premised on the grounds on the face of the Motion and supported by the Affidavit of George Boniface Mbugua, the Plaintiff herein dated 1st October 2021.",
            "3.  The Plaintiff deponed that sometime in 1986, he entered into an agreement with the Defendant for the purchase of all that property known as L.R No.1/387 situate along Ngong Road, Nairobi; that the purchase price of the property was Kshs 2,000,000, which sum he duly paid and thereafter took possession of the property as a purchaser for value and that the Defendant nevertheless declined to transfer the property to him on allegations that he had not completed payment of the purchase price.",
            "4.  According to the Plaintiff, the Defendant’s refusal to transfer the suit property led him institute the present suit seeking for orders of specific performance. The Plaintiff deponed that the matter proceeded for trial after which the court, vide it’s Judgment of 31st May 2018, found in his favour and ordered the transfer of the suit property into his name and that the Defendant subsequently filed an appeal being Nairobi Civil Appeal No.242 of 2018.",
            "5.  It is the deposition of the Plaintiff that the Court of Appeal, vide its decision of 8th November 2019, overturned the trial court’s Judgment in its entirety and remitted the matter to this court for assessment of rent/mesne profits/damages due to the Defendant and that the assessment of the rent/mesne profits/damages aforesaid was to be done taking into account the sum of Kshs 1,500,000 paid by the Plaintiff towards the purchase in 1987.",
            "6.  It is the Plaintiff’s deposition that the issue of assessment of mesne profits is pending in this court; that he would like to file additional documents being a valuation report and a financial analyst report showing the increase of the value of Kshs 1,500,000 from 1987 to 2021 and that his advocate made an oral application seeking to have the aforestated documents adduced but the court, in its Ruling of 23rd September 2021, declined to grant the same on the grounds that allowing additional evidence would go against the Court of Appeal Judgment.  ",
            "7.  The Plaintiff deponed that he is dissatisfied with the Ruling delivered by this court (Obaga J.) on 23rd September 2021 on the ground that there is an error apparent on the face of the record; that the court did not consider that to come up with an accurate figure, it would need to base its assessment of mesne profits on reports and/or further documents and that there is sufficient reason to review and set aside the said Ruling.",
            "8.  The Plaintiff contends that there is no document on record showing the current value of the suit property; that the Court of Appeal, while finding that the sale had aborted, and the Defendant had not refunded the sum of Kshs 1,500,000 paid by the Plaintiff, directed that the assessment of mesne profits be done taking into account the aforestated sum of Kshs 1,500,000; that the value of Kshs 1,500,000 paid in 1987 has appreciated and that the increase in value of the said sum should be considered in the assessment, failure to which the Defendant will be unjustly enriched,",
            "9.   According to the Plaintiff, this suit sought to compel the Defendant to transfer the suit property to the Plaintiff and hence the aspect of the value of Kshs 1,500,000 was not in issue; that it is not possible for this court to make an assessment of mesne profits without an expert’s report showing the value of Kshs 1,500,000 from 1987 to date and that the filing of new evidence in this regard does not amount to re-opening the suit because the issue of ownership of the suit property was finally determined by the Court of Appeal.",
            "10.  In response to the Application, the 1st Defendant filed Grounds of Opposition dated 14th October 2021 in which it averred that;",
            "i.   The Application is utterly misconceived and wanting in substance and raises no sufficient grounds warranting the review and/or setting aside of the Ruling and orders of the Honourable Justice Obaga issued on the 23rd September 2021.",
            "ii.  This Court has no jurisdiction to deviate and/or interfere with the directions contained in the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No. 242 of 2018: Mohammed Jawayd Iqbal Vs George Boniface Mbugua delivered on the 8th of November 2019 and purport to review the orders as sought.",
            "iii. This Court has no jurisdiction to allow the parties herein to file additional evidence for the assessment of mesne profits as the Court of Appeal has already set the parameters for assessment as per its Judgment delivered on the 8th of November 2019.",
            "iv. The review and/or setting aside of the Ruling and orders as sought by the Applicant is untenable both in law and in fact, and is frivolous, vexatious and amounts to a gross abuse of the court process and a total waste of the Courts time.",
            "v.  The Application is solely aimed at attempting to alter the Judgment of the Court of Appeal through the back door despite the fact that the Court of Appeal itself refused to review its Judgment upon application by the Plaintiff/Applicant herein.",
            "vi. That the instant Application is frivolous, vexatious and lacks a legal basis and as such the same ought to be dismissed in limine.",
            "Submissions",
            "11.   The Application was canvassed by way of oral submissions. The Plaintiff’s advocate submitted that the question of whether Kshs 500,000 of the purchase price had been paid arose during the trial, the payment of Kshs 1,500,000 being undisputed; that the ELC Court in determining the matter found that the Plaintiff had fully paid the purchase price and ordered the suit property to be transferred to the Plaintiff and that the Defendant preferred an appeal and the Court of Appeal determined that there was no evidence of the payment of Kshs 500,000 by the Plaintiff.",
            "12.  Counsel submitted that the Court of Appeal overturned the trial court’s Judgment and remitted the matter to this court for assessment of mesne profits and damages; that he sought leave to adduce additional evidence with regard to the assessment of the mesne profits and damages but the same was declined and that the court (Obaga J.) held that the only way the assessment was to be done was through the evidence already adduced at trial.",
            "13.  Counsel for the Plaintiff urged that this is a court of justice and should not allow the Plaintiff to be unjustly enriched; that the issue of quantum was never determined by the court and that the sum of Kshs 1,500,000/= paid in 1987 does not have the same value today and it is imperative that evidence to that effect is provided to the court to aid it arrive at a just decision. Counsel submitted that the Plaintiff was in possession of additional evidence which was not available when Obaga J. delivered his Ruling.",
            "14.  It was submitted by counsel for the Defendant that the Plaintiff’s application is frivolous; that the Plaintiff has not made out a case for review of the Ruling of Obaga J and that whereas the Plaintiff seeks to show the current value of Kshs 1,500,000, the Court of Appeal directed this Court to assess the rent/mesne profits payable to the Defendant only.",
            "15.  According to the Defendant’s counsel, the rent/mesne profits sought to be assessed are with respect to the Defendant’s counter-claim; that all that this  court is required to do is to assess the damages and deduct the sum of Kshs 1,500,000 payable to the Plaintiff from it; that consequently, no additional evidence is required as the onus is on the Defendant to prove his counterclaim and that there is no error apparent on the face of the record or sufficient reasons to review the Ruling of this court.",
            "16.  In response, counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that for the Defendant to seek to take possession of the land, and for the Plaintiff to pay him mesne profits, less the amount paid in 1986, the same would amount to a mechanical approach by the court and will be contrary to the concept of unjust enrichment as pronounced by the Court of Appeal in its Judgment.",
            "Analysis & Determination",
            "17.  Having considered the pleadings and oral submissions by counsel, the only issue that arises for determination is   whether the Plaintiff has made out a case warranting a review of the Ruling of this court (Obaga J.) delivered on 23rd September 2021.",
            "18.  The law governing applications for review is set out in Section 80 of the Civil Procedure Act and Order 45, Rule 1(1) of the Civil Procedure Rules. Section 80 of the Act provides as follows:",
            "80. Any person who considers himself aggrieved-",
            "(a) by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed by this Act, but from which no appeal has been preferred; or",
            "(b) by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed by this Act,",
            "May apply for a review of Judgment to the court which passed the decree or made the order, and the court may make such order thereon as it thinks fit.",
            "19.  Order 45 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 provides as follows:-",
            "(1)  Any person considering himself aggrieved-",
            "(a)  By a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred; or",
            "(b)  By a decree or order from which no appeal is hereby allowed, and who from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree or order, may apply for review of Judgment to the court which passed the decree or made the order without unreasonable delay.”",
            "20. The provisions of Order 45 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules were restated by the Court of Appeal in Benjoh Amalgamated Limited and another v Kenya Commercial Bank Limited [2014] eKLR as follows:",
            "“In the High court, both the Civil Procedure Act in section 80 and the Civil Procedure Rules in Order 45 rule 1 confer on the court power to review. Rule 1 of Order 45 shows the circumstances in which such review would be considered ranging from discovery of new and important matter or mistake or error apparent on the face of the record or any other sufficient reason but section 80 gives the High Court greater amplitude for review”.",
            "21.   The reading of the law shows that the power of the court to review its Judgments and Rulings is not absolute and is hedged in by the restrictions indicated in Order 45 of the Civil Procedure Rules.  The power can be exercised upon discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within the Applicant’s knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the order was made.",
            "22.  The power can also be exercised on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record or for any other sufficient reason. The power of review can be exercised only for correction of a patent error of law or fact which stares one in the face without any elaborate argument being needed for stabling it.",
            "23.  While discussing the concept of mistake or error on the face of the record, the Court of Appeal in Kenya Trypanosomiasis Research Institute v Anthony Kabimba Gusinjilu (Suing for and on behalf of 112 Plaintiffs) [2019] eKLR referred to its various decisions as follows;",
            "“This Court in Muyodi vs. Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation & Another [2006] 1 EA 243 described an error on the face of the record as follows:",
            "In Nyamogo and Nyamogo v Kogo [2001] EA 174 this court said that an error apparent on the face of the record cannot be defined precisely or exhaustively, there being an element of indefiniteness inherent in its very nature, and it must be left to be determined judicially on the facts of each case. There is real distinction between a mere erroneous decision and an error apparent on the face of the record. Where an error on a substantial point of law stares one in the face, and there could reasonably be no two opinions, a clear case of error apparent on the face of the record would be made out. An error which has to be established by a long drawn process of reasoning or on points where there may conceivably be two opinions can hardly be said to be an error apparent on the face of the record. Again, if a view adopted by the court in the original record is a possible one, it cannot be an error apparent on the face of the record even though another view was also possible. Mere error or wrong view is certainly no ground for a review although it may be for an appeal. This laid down principle of law is indeed applicable in the matter before us.”",
            "24.  This position was also restated by the Ugandan Court of Appeal in the case of Apollo Waswa Basude & 2 others (As administrators to the Estate of the late Sepiriya Rosiko) Vs Nsabwa Ham, Civil Appeal No 288 of 2016, where the court at para 310 stated thus;",
            "“…an error apparent on the face of the record is one that is evident and its incorrectness does not require any extraneous matter by way of proof. It is so manifest and clear that no court of law exercising its judicial power would allow it to remain on the court record. This error may be either of fact or of law…”",
            "25.  Briefly, the background to this matter is that the Plaintiff instituted this suit against the Defendant seeking orders of specific performance. The trail court found in favour of the Plaintiff by granting the order of specific performance. Aggrieved by the decision of the trial court, the Defendant filed an appeal in the Court of Appeal. In its Judgment, the Court of Appeal overturned the trial court’s decision and remitted the matter to this court for assessment of the rent/mesne profits/damages due to the Defendant.",
            "26.  Before the matter could proceed for assessment of mesne profits and or damages, counsel for the Plaintiff made an oral application seeking to call the evidence of an economist and a valuer to guide the court on the issue of inflation. In opposition to the application by the Plaintiff to call for fresh evidence, counsel for the Defendant informed the court that the Judgment of the Court of Appeal was clear that the matter had been referred back to this court for assessment of damages and or mesne profits, which assessment should be based on the evidence on record. Counsel for the Defendant submitted that admitting new evidence was akin to re-opening the case.",
            "27.  Vide its Ruling of 23rd September 2021, this court (Obaga J.) disallowed the request by the Plaintiff to adduce additional evidence. The court stated as follows:",
            "“The Court of Appeal was clear that despite the trial court referring to the evidence of a valuer who had been called by the Defendant and identifying the issue of whether the Defendant was entitled to rent as claimed in the counter-claim, never addressed the issue in the Judgment. It is therefore clear that this court was only to assess mesne profits based on the evidence which was adduced during the trial. Allowing additional evidence will clearly go against the order of the Court of Appeal. I therefore disallow the request by the Plaintiff to adduce additional evidence during the assessment of mesne profits”.",
            "28. The Plaintiff contends that that there is an error apparent on the face of the record and sufficient reasons to review the Ruling of the court. The basis of this argument is that the court “did not consider that to come up with an accurate figure, it will need to base its assessment of mesne profits on reports and/or further documents.” The Plaintiff opines that there is no document on the court record showing the current value of Kshs 1,500,000 that the Plaintiff paid to the Defendant in 1986.",
            "29.  The fact that the court declined to allow new evidence to be adduced or that it failed to consider the need for such additional evidence to assess mesne profits/damages cannot by any stretch be said to be tantamount to an error on the face of the record. In my view, what the Plaintiff is questioning is this court’s interpretation of the Court of Appeal directions in respect to the assessment of mesne profits/damages.",
            "30.  The issue of whether the interpretation of the Judgment of the Court of Appeal by this court is right or wrong requires lengthy deliberations, with probably divergent opinions. In the instant case therefore, this court is not convinced that there is an error apparent on the face of the record. ",
            "31.  Further, the court having determined that it was precluded from allowing any additional evidence by the Court of Appeal, the Defendant should have lodged an appeal against the said Ruling as opposed to filing an application for review. As stated by the Court of Appeal in Nyamongo vs Nyamongo (supra) and Pancras T. Swai v Kenya Breweries Limited [2014] eKLR, a mere error or a wrong view by the court is certainly not a ground for a review, although it may be for an appeal.",
            "32.  That being the case, it is my finding that the Plaintiff has failed to show that there is an error apparent on the face of the record to warrant the review of the Ruling of 23rd September,2021.",
            "33.  The second limb of the Plaintiff’s prayer for review is premised on the ground of “any other sufficient reasons”. The scope of the ground “for any other sufficient reason” has been subject to different interpretations by the courts. There are two schools of thought, the first one being that the “sufficient reason” alluded to must be analogous to the grounds pertaining to discovery of new evidence or error on the face of the record while the second view is that the “sufficient reason” need not be analogous to the previous grounds.",
            "34.  In the case of Nasibwa Wakenya Moses vs. University of Nairobi & Another [2019] eKLR, Mativo J held as follows:",
            "“An application for review may be allowed on any other “sufficient reason.” The phrase ‘sufficient reason’ within the meaning of the above rule means analogous or ejusdem generis to the other reasons stipulated in Order 45 Rule 1.  This position was illuminated in Sadar Mohamed vs Charan Singh and Another [13] where the court held that: -",
            "“Any other sufficient reason for the purposes of review refers to grounds analogous to the other two (for example error on the face of the record and discovery of new matter).”",
            "Mulla in the Code of Civil Procedure [14] (writing on Order 47 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code of India), (the equivalent of our Order 45 Rule 1), states that the expression 'any other sufficient reason’...means a reason sufficiently analogous to those specified in the rule. Any other attempt, except an attempt to correct an apparent error or an attempt not based on any ground set out in the rules, would amount to an abuse of the liberty given to the tribunal under the Act to review its Judgment.",
            "Perhaps it is worth citing Evan Bwire vs Andrew Nginda [15] where the court held that ‘an application for review will only be allowed on very strong grounds particularly if its effect will amount to re-opening the application or case a fresh.”",
            "35.  Similarly, the Court of Appeal in the case of Assets Recovery Agency vs Charity Wangui Gethi & 3 others [2020] eKLR stated that;-",
            "“The ground “other sufficient reason” has been held to be consonant with the first two grounds: See Kuria v Shah [1990] KLR 316.”",
            "36.  However, the Court of Appeal in Pancras T. Swai v Kenya Breweries Limited [2014] eKLR was of a contrary view and adopted the position that “sufficient reasons” need not be analogous by stating;",
            "“As repeatedly pointed out in various decisions of this Court, the words, “for any sufficient reason” must be viewed in the context firstly of Section 80 of the Civil Procedure Act, Cap 21, which confers an unfettered right to apply for review and secondly on the current jurisprudential thinking that the words need not be analogous with the other grounds specified in the order.  In Sarder Mohamed v. Charan Singh Nand Singh and Another (1959) EA 793, the High Court correctly held that Section 80 of the Civil Procedure Act conferred an unfettered discretion in the Court to make such order as it thinks fit on review and that the omission of any qualifying words in the Section was deliberate. In Shanzu Investments Limited v. Commissioner for Lands (Civil Appeal No. 100 of 1993) this Court with respect, correctly invoked and applied its earlier decision in Wangechi Kimata & Another vs Charan Singh (C.A. No. 80 of 1985) (unreported) wherein this Court held that",
            "“any other sufficient reason need not be analogous with the other grounds set out in the rule because such restriction would be a clog on the unfettered right given to the Court by Section 80 of the Civil Procedure Act; and that the other grounds set out in the rule did not in themselves form a genus or class of things which the third general head could be said to be analogous.”",
            "37.  This court adopts the position that “any sufficient reason” must not be analogous to the grounds of discovery of new evidence and/or error apparent on the face of the record. I say so because there could by other compelling reasons, not contemplated under Order45 Rule (1) of the Civil Procedure Rules, which may necessitate the review of a decree or an order.",
            "38. As to whether the Plaintiff in the current application has succeeded in convincing this court that there exists “a sufficient reason” to review its orders of 23rd September, 2021, it is my view that it has not. I say so because the Plaintiff’s application is based on the fact that if the Defendant was to refund to the Plaintiff Kshs. 1,500,000 that was paid in 1987, he (the Defendant) will be enriched unjustly.",
            "39.  In my view, whether the Plaintiff should be refunded more than the Kshs. 1,500,000 that he paid to the Defendant due to inflation should have been canvassed at the Court of Appeal. Indeed, the Court of Appeal was categorical on the amount that is payable to the Plaintiff as follows:",
            "“Following the failure of the agreements between the parties, what should have happened is a return of the purchase price to Nyanja paid in part…whereas the appellant as the innocent party would have been entitled to damages for breach of contract from Nyanja, such damages would have to be set off against the Kshs. 1,500,000,000 that Nyanja paid to the deceased and his estate between 1985 and 1987. He would otherwise be unjustly enriched and the court cannot countenance that, either…We remit this matter to the Environment and Land Court for assessment of the rent/mesne profits/damages the appellant is entitled to only, while taking into account the sum of Kshs. 1,500,000 paid towards the abortive purchase of the suit premises.”",
            "40.  This court’s mandate as directed by the Court of Appeal is to assess the rent/mesne profits/damages payable to the Defendant while taking into account the Kshs. 1,500,000 paid by the Plaintiff, and not any other amount.  In view of the conclusions herein above, the court finds that the Plaintiff has not met the necessary threshold to warrant the orders sought.",
            "41.  For those reasons, the Plaintiff’s Application dated 1st October 2021 is dismissed with costs.",

            "RULING",
            "1. This is a ruling on the 1st Defendant/Applicant’s Notice of Motion dated 21st June 2021 and Preliminary Objection filed together with his written statement of Defence which this court ordered to be heard together.  There is also on record a Notice of Motion dated 30th September 2021 by which the 7th Defendant (Aduma Joshua Owuor) seeks similar orders as those sought by the 1st Defendant/Applicant though on different grounds.",
            "2. The 12th Defendant (James Mimi Mbugua) also filed a Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 12th July 2021 which raises similar grounds as those raised in the Notice of Motion of the 1st Defendant/Applicant and this ruling shall therefore apply to it.  In the Notice of Motion dated 21ST June 2021 the 1st Defendant/Applicant  principally seeks orders that:-",
            "1. This Honourable Court be pleased to strike out this suit in its entirety for being an abuse of the court process.",
            "2. In the Alternative, that this suit be stayed pending hearing and determination of HCC ACEC No. 30 of 2019 formerly HC Petition No. 366 of 2019 and Chief Magistrates Anti-Corruption Criminal case No. 8 of 2019.",
            "3. The gist of the application as can be discerned from the grounds on its face and in the supporting affidavit of Evans Odhiambo Kidero the applicant sworn on 21st June 2021 is firstly that the suit herein stems from Chief Magistrate Anti-Corruption case No. 8 of 2019 which he has challenged in this court vide High Court Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Petition No. 30 of 2019 and it is apparent that this suit is intended to defeat High Court Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Petition No. 30 of 2019 in the event that the same is allowed ; that in view of the existence of the other two cases, this suit is brought in bad faith; that this suit would prejudice, embarrass and delay the fair trial of High Court Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Petition No. 30 OF 2019 which contests the charges in the criminal case; that in view of the provisions of Section 48 of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act regarding the punishment in the event one is convicted, it defeats justice to have another Civil Suit which would lead to the same punishment/penalty; that Section 54 of Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act  provides for compensation  similar to what is sought to be achieved by this case; that in light of the petition in High Court Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Petition No. 30 of 2019 it is only fair and just that this suit be struck out or be stayed pending hearing and determination of the petition and further that this suit is brought in bad faith as it only seeks to discredit the applicant under Chapter 6 of the Constitution and also under the Leadership and Integrity Act and is aimed at barring him from vying for a gubernatorial seat in the general elections of 2022.  The 1st Defendant/Applicant further avers that it is in the interest of justice that the orders sought are granted.  He contends that even the criminal proceedings against him in the Chief Magistrates Anti-Corruption court are motivated by an ulterior motive which is why he filed High Court Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Petition No. 30 of 2019.",
            "4. The 1st Defendant/Applicant’s preliminary objection challenges the jurisdiction of this court to hear this suit. The grounds cited are that there are already two other cases (Chief Magistrates Anti-Corruption Court case No 8 of 2019 and High Court Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Petition No. 30 of 2019) which ostensibly deal with the same subject matter and that given the existence of the other two, this suit is an abuse of court process.",
            "5. The notice of preliminary objection filed by the 12th Respondent is premised on grounds that:-",
            "“1. The suit directly infringes on the 12th Defendant’s  Constitutional Right to a fair trial as enshrined in Article 50 (1) (2) (a), (c), (d), (e) and (k) to the extent that;",
            "a)  There exists before the Nairobi Chief Magistrate Court, ACC No. 8 of 2019, R Vs Dr. Evans Kidero & 15 Others, pending hearing and determination in which the matter in issue, is also substantially and directly in issue herein.",
            "b)  The suit maliciously elevates unproved facts and assertions by the plaintiff in contravention of presumption of innocence of the 12th Defendant;",
            "c)  The 12th Defendant has not been found Guilty of “Corruption” or “Economic Crime” before a court of law and any such assertion and the resultant liability either by himself or with others is vexatious at the best and an attempt to collectively attribute baseless monetary liability;",
            "d) The suit contravenes the Right if the 12th Defendant to adequate time and facilities to prepare for his defence in Nairobi Chief Magistrate Court, ACC No 8 of 2019, R Vs Dr. Evans Kidera & 15 Others;",
            "e)   The Suit contravenes the Right of the 12th Defendant to a having his trial begin and conclude without unreasonable delay; and",
            "f) The Suit contravenes the Right of the 12th Defendant to adduce and challenge the evidence without self-incrimination in Nairobi Chief Magistrate Court, ACC No 8 of 2019, R Vs Dr. Evans Kidero & 15 Others. ",
            "2.  The Plaintiff lacks locus standi to file a representative suit on behalf of the County Government of Nairobi in Contravention of Order 2 (8) of the Civil Procedure Rules.",
            "3.  The suit is in Contravention of Section 6 of the Civil Procedure Act and discloses no reasonable cause of action against the 12th Defendant.",
            "4.  The suit is intended to Prejudice, Embarrass and Delay the 12th Defendant’s trial in Nairobi Chief Magistrate Court, ACC No 8 of 2019, R Vs Dr. Evans Kidero & 15 Others   ",
            "6. The Notice of Motion dated 21st June 2021 and the preliminary objection were canvassed by way of written submissions. During the highlighting of the submissions the learned Counsel appearing for the 2nd to 14th Defendants intimated that they were in support of this application and did not wish to add anything.  On his part, Mr. Mohochi, learned Counsel for the 12th Respondent intimated that he filed his application on 12th July 2021 but as he did not wish to occasion delay this court could go ahead and hear the application of the 1st Defendant/Applicant. This court therefore proceeded to hear the application and the preliminary points of law raised as if it was solely between the 1st Defendant/Applicant and the Plaintiff/Respondent but bearing in mind that the other Defendants support the same.  Be that as it may as the issues raised in the preliminary objection of the 12th Respondent are similar to those raised by the 1st Defendant/Applicant this ruling shall apply mutatis mutandis to the preliminary objection of the 12th Respondent.",
            "7. Briefly the 1st Defendant/Applicant’s case is that the criminal case filed in the Chief magistrate’s court stems from an alleged irregular approval and payment of a sum of Kshs. 58, 000, 000 to the firm of Wachira Mburu & Company Advocates as legal fees in HCCC 875 of 2010.  He contends that the charges against him do not have any factual or legal basis because the said HCCC No. 875 of 2010 Kyavee Holdings Limited Vs City Council of Nairobi was heard, determined and the legal fees processed and paid before he became the Governor of the County Government of Nairobi; that in any event the firm of Wachira Mburu & Co. Advocates having represented the defunct City Council  was entitled to the remuneration; that the Forensic Report that gave rise to the charges against him was erroneous and that the  inference created that he acquired a sum of Kshs. 14,400,000 from M/S Cups Limited as proceeds of crime was erroneous as the said sum was the  consideration paid to him by M/S Cups Limited for sale of a motor vehicle Regn. No. KBT 001 Toyota Lexus.  It is his contention that the criminal charges were instituted to achieve ulterior political motives against him and that he filed HC Petition Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Petition No. 30 of 2019 to challenge the charges and to have them quashed. It is the 1st Defendant/Applicant‘s case that the present suit seeks to recover the sum of Kshs. 14, 400, 000 which is the subject of the criminal charges in Chief Magistrate Anti-Corruption Court case No. 8 of 2019 and that those are the same charges that he is asking this court to quash in High Court Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Petition No. 30 of 2019.  He contends and that is also the submission of his Counsel, Prof Tom Ojienda SC, that this suit is intended to defeat the outcome of the petition and is therefore an abuse of the court process.",
            "8. He also submits that the sum of Kshs. 14, 400, 000 ought to be recovered with interest upon the conclusion of the criminal case and only if there is a conviction as provided under Sections 48(1) and 54 of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act. It is his further submission that it is in the public interest to stay civil proceedings where the same are filed concurrently with Criminal proceedings.",
            "9. In support of his submissions Prof, Tom Ojienda SC learned Counsel for the 1st Defendant/Applicant relied on the following cases:-",
            "·   Cephas Kamande Mwaura Vs Republic [2021] eKLR where the court stated:-",
            "“……The sentence imposed against him was not a mandatory sentence. The court that imposed the sentence had discretion, within the parameters of the sentence prescribed by ACECA, to impose either a fine or custodial sentence.”",
            "·   Ethic and Anti-Corruption Commission Vs Jamal Bare Mohamed [2019] eKLR where it was observed that under Section 54 of ACECA there has to be a conviction before any compensation can be made and that enforcement under that section is done by the person in whose favour the order was made and as if the order was made in civil proceedings.",
            "·   Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission Vs Judith Marilyn Okungu & another [2013] eKLR where the court was of the view that because the defendants therein were charged in a criminal case with an offence under Section 45 as read with Section 48 of ACECA, 2003 and upon their conviction they were liable to pay compensation as provided in Section 54 of the Act then bringing a civil suit against them was akin to using a double edged sword and it was prejudicial to the Defendants and smacked of harassment.  That court went ahead and stayed the civil suit to await determination of the criminal case facing the defendants.",
            "·   Florence Ndalama Vs Mwene Lumpepe Mhango & Co. AS Administrators of Malawi Railways Limited & Rwasa Pascal T/A Pascal Investment Land Cause No. 59 of 2013 where again the court stayed the civil proceeding upon a finding that it was wrong and premature to give judgment in a civil case where a decision in a concurrent criminal case had to be made on the same facts.",
            "·   Other cases cited are:-",
            "a) Githunguri Vs Republic [1985] KLR 3090 ",
            "b) Ethics & Anti-Corruption Commission Vs Peter Mangiti & 17 Others [2016] eKLR where the court stated:-",
            "“It is a fact that this current civil suit stems from the criminal case which charges the Applicant herein has disputed in the Petition.  The courts have held that it is in the public interest to stay civil proceedings where criminal and civil matters have been made to run concurrently.  The Court in Miscellaneous Application 7 of 2016 Ethics& Anti-Corruption Vs Peter Mangiti & 17 others [2016] eKLR stated that: ’22. .….the normal procedure in the co-existence of civil and criminal proceedings is to stay the civil proceedings pending the determination of the criminal cases as the determination of the criminal cases as the determination of civil rights and obligations are not the subject of a criminal prosecution.” 23…… “In such instances, where there is a co-existence of a civil suit and a criminal case, it is rather that a stay be granted on the civil process pending the completion of the criminal case……24.  In the case of Jadra Karsan –vs- Harnam Singh (1953) 20 E.A.C.A 74  it was held; “There is no doubt that there is an inherent power of stay of proceedings where the ends of justice so require.” 25. This being a public interest mater and being guided by the above authorities, I do find that it is in the public interest as well as the interest of parties that one of these cases be stayed pending the hearing and determination of the other…..’ ",
            "10. Counsel concluded by stating that this civil suit, the criminal case and the petition are intricately intertwined and any decision on the petition and criminal case would have a direct effect on this suit and it is therefore in the public interest that the suit herein is struck out and or stayed pending the hearing of the criminal case and the petition. Counsel also argued that this suit compromised the 1st Defendant/Applicant’s right to fair trial (Article 50 of the Constitution) in the criminal proceeding. He reiterated his submission that the suit is an abuse of the court process and urged this court therefore to allow the Notice of Motion and the preliminary objection as prayed.",
            "11. The application and Notice of Motion were vehemently resisted by the Plaintiff/Respondent.  In opposition the Plaintiff/Respondent filed Grounds of opposition dated 1st July 2021, a Replying affidavit sworn by Mulki Omar on even date and written submissions dated 4th August 2021 the gist of which is that this suit is filed pursuant to the plaintiff’s statutory mandate under Section 11 (l) (j) of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2011; that under Sections 55 and 56 of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act (ACECA) the Commission is mandated to institute and conduct proceedings for the purpose of recovery or protection of public property or for the freezing or confiscation of proceeds of corruption or related to corruption, or the payment of compensation or other punitive and disciplinary measures; that the import of the 1st Dependant/Applicant’s application is to interfere with the Constitutional and Statutory mandate of the Respondent and further that the Applicant has not demonstrated the existence of ulterior motive in the institution of the suit and that moreover the 1st Defendant/Applicant has filed its defence in the suit and will not therefore suffer prejudice. The Respondent has also argued that the hearing of Chief Magistrates Anti-Corruption Court case No. 8 of 2019 has not commenced and that in any event the legal sanctions there-at are distinct from those in this suit and that this application is merely intended to delay the hearing of this suit as the applicants are intent on frustrating any proceedings filed against them in relation to the subject matter both here and in the lower court.  It is also contended that the effect of the orders sought would be to cloth the 1st Defendant/Applicant with immunity in total disregard of the Constitutional and legal authority of the Respondent to ensure that persons alleged to have committed corruption and economic crimes do not benefit from corrupt conduct.  Counsel for the respondent further asserted that the grounds for the application are not supported by evidence and are merely calculated to attract sympathy from the court and stall any proceedings related to the matters in issue in furtherance of the 1st Defendant/Applicant’s personal ambition. Counsel asserted that by virtue of Section 193A of the Criminal Procedure Code criminal proceedings can run concurrently with civil proceedings and the fact that any matter in issue in criminal proceedings is also in issue in a pending civil suit cannot be a ground for stay, prohibition or delay of the latter.",
            "12. In regard to the prayer seeking to strike out the suit Counsel submitted that whereas this application is made under Order 2 Rule 15 (1) of the Civil Procedure Rules subrule 15 (2) provides that no evidence is admissible in such an application and that it ought to be evident from the grounds on the face of the application that no reasonable cause of action is demonstrated by the pleading sought to be struck out.  Counsel contended that the plaint herein discloses a cause of action against the Applicant. Citing the case of D T Dobie & Company (Kenya) Limited Vs Joseph Mbaria Muchina & another [1980] eKLR Counsel cautioned that this court ought to exercise its power to strike out sparingly.  Counsel further asserted that the suit has passed the test to be heard as it raises triable issues and it ought to be determined on its merit through discovery and oral evidence tested by cross examination.  To support this submission Counsel cited the case of Wenlock Vs Moloney [1965] 2 AII E.R 871 where Danckwerts LJ stated:-",
            "“There is no doubt that the inherent power of the Court remains; but this summary jurisdiction of the court was never intended to be exercised by a minute and protracted examination of the documents and facts of the case in order to see whether the plaintiff really has a cause of action.  To do that is to usurp the position of the trial judge and to produce a trial of the case in chambers, on affidavits only, without discovery and without oral evidence tested by cross-examination in the ordinary way.  This seems to me to be an abuse of the inherent power of the court and not a proper exercise of that power. The learned master stated the relevant principles and practice correctly enough, and then, I am afraid, failed to apply them to the case.”",
            "13. Counsel for the Respondent also urged this court to peruse the affidavit of Mulki Omar sworn on 1st July 2021 to confirm that triable issues are raised and to further note that payment of the impugned sum of Kshs. 58,000,000 to the firm of Wachira Mburu Mwangi & Co. Advocates took place on 7th January 2014.  Counsel also stated that Civil proceedings for forfeiture are distinct from the punishment prescribed in Section 54 of the ACECA and that proceedings under Section 11 (1) (j) of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission Act are not punitive but merely intended to ensure that no person gains from ill-gotten wealth.  To support her submissions and the submission that there needed to be no criminal conviction for recovery proceedings to be instituted Counsel cited the following cases:",
            "·   Teckla Nandjila Lameck & another Vs The President of the Republic of Namibia & others case No; A54/2011",
            "·   Claim No. 20/2 HC Vs 02/20 between the Assets Recovery Agency and Audrene Samantha Rowe and 3 others [2014] JMSC civ 2 ",
            "·   Assets Recovery Agency Vs James Thuita Nderitu & 6 others [2020] eKLR ",
            "·   Assets Recovery Agency Vs. Lilian Wanja Muthoni t/a Sahara Consultants & 5 others [2020] eKLR where the court stated:-",
            "“This is a claim for civil recovery. A claim for civil recovery can be determined on the basis of conduct in relation to property without the identification of any particular unlawful conduct. The Plaintiff herein is therefore not required to prove that the Defendant actually committed an act of corruption in order to invoke the provisions of the ACECA.  In the case of Director of Assets Recovery Agency & Ors, Republic versus Green & Ors [2005] EWHC 3168 the court stated that:",
            "“In civil proceeding for recovery under Part 5 of the Act the Director need not allege the commission of any specific criminal offence but must set out the matters that are alleged to constitute the particular kind or kinds of unlawful conduct by or in return for which the property was obtained.” I opine that forfeiture is a fair remedy in this instance as it serves to take away that which was not legitimately acquired without the stigma of criminal conviction.  Criminal forfeiture requires a criminal trial and conviction while civil forfeiture is employed where the subject of inquiry has not been convicted of the underlying criminal offence, whether as a result of lack of admissible evidence, or a failure to discharge the burden of proof in a criminal trial.  See – Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission v James Mwathethe Mulewa & another [2017] eKLR” (Emphasis added).",
            "14. Based on the above decisions Counsel for the respondent urged that civil forfeiture should not be viewed as an alternative or substitute for the institution of criminal proceedings; that the Applicant has not demonstrated any real risk of serious prejudice as would lead to injustice in either one or both proceedings and further that Sections 1A, 3A and 63I of the Civil Procedure Act upon which the application is predicated are aimed at supplementing this court’s power to do justice but are not intended to interfere with the powers of the Plaintiff/Respondent.  Counsel reiterated that the application herein is merely intended to delay the hearing of this suit and that it is in the public interest that this suit be heard to its logical conclusion and be determined on its merits.  She prayed that the application be dismissed with costs to the Plaintiff/Respondent.",
            "15. In a brief rejoinder Prof Tom Ojienda SC pointed out that Counsel for the respondent failed to point out the similarities between this case and HCACEC Petition No. 30 of 2019. He also pointed out that Counsel for the Respondent did not state whether or not she is prosecuting the criminal case in the Chief Magistrate’s court and reiterated that where there is a criminal case there must be a judgment before a recovery suit is commenced.  He urged this court to allow the application.",
            "16. Analysis and Determination",
            "I have considered the application, the grounds thereof, the supporting affidavit, the notices of preliminary objection, the replying affidavit and grounds of opposition, the rival submissions of the learned Advocates for the parties both written and oral, the cases cited and the law.  The central issues in this application are whether the same meets the test for the prayer for striking out under Order 2 Rule 15(1) of the Civil Procedure Act; whether this suit can properly and lawfully co-exist with the criminal proceedings in the Chief Magistrates Anti-Corruption court and the Petition by which the 1st Defendant/Applicant and his co-accused have challenged the criminal proceedings, whether this suit will compromise the 1st Defendant/Applicant’s right in the Criminal proceedings and whether the decision in this suit will adversely impact HC ACECA Petition No. 30 of 2019 were the same.",
            "17. On the main the 1st Defendant/Applicant seeks an order to strike out this suit in its entirety on the ground that it is an abuse of the court process. The prayer for stay of the suit pending the hearing and determination of the Criminal proceedings and the Petition challenging those proceedings is an alternative prayer.  Striking out pleadings for being an abuse of the process of court is provided for in Order 2 Rule 15(1) (d) of the Civil Procedure Rules.  Abuse of court process is a ground distinct from the ground that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence in law provided for in Rule 15(1) (a). My reading of Order 2 Rule 15(2) is that the rule barring adduction of evidence applies only to applications brought under sub rule 1(a) so that a party bringing an application to strike out a pleading for being an abuse of the court process is therefore not prevented from adducing evidence in support of the application. Be that as it may it is trite that striking out a pleading is draconian and the discretion to do so must be exercised sparingly and only in the clearest of cases. To demonstrate that this suit is an abuse of the court process, the 1st Defendant/Applicant has adduced evidence that there are criminal proceedings based on the same subject matter and that he has filed a petition challenging those criminal proceedings in this very court.  He has also in this suit challenged the charges levelled against him in the criminal proceedings by stating that the money the subject matter in both cases was paid long before he became the Governor of the County Government of Nairobi. It is also his contention that both the criminal proceedings and this suit are actuated by ulterior motives and that he will suffer prejudice should this suit be allowed to proceed concurrently with the criminal proceedings and the petition.  He surmises that the Plaintiff/Respondent’s motive for bringing this suit is to defeat the orders that may eventually be granted in the petition should it be determined in his favour. ",
            "18. My finding however is that he has not persuaded this court that this suit is an abuse of the court process.  There is no dispute that the Plaintiff/Respondent is vested with power under Section 11 (1) (j) of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission Act to institute and conduct proceedings in court for purposes of the recovery or protection of public property, or for the freeze or confiscation of proceeds of corruption or related to corruption or the payment of compensation, or other punitive and disciplinary measures including proceedings for the recovery of property or proceeds of corruption located outside Kenya. This function is distinct from that provided in Section 11 (1) (d) – investigate and recommend to the Director of Prosecutions the prosecution of any act of corruption, bribery or economic Crimes and other related conduct in that the former relates to civil proceedings and the latter to criminal proceedings. The prevention, investigation and punishment of corruption, economic crime and related offences and for matters incidental thereto and connected therewith are regulated by the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act (ACECA) and the criminal charges against the 1st Defendant/Applicant and his co-defendants are brought under that Act. The Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act also regulates the proceedings for compensation and recovery of corruptly acquired property.  Section 51 of the Act states that a “person who does anything that constitutes corruption or economic crimes is liable to anyone who suffers a loss as a result for an amount that would be full compensation for the loss suffered.”  Section 53 (3) of the Act states that an amount for which a person is liable under Section 51 or 52 to a public body may be recovered by the public body or by the Commission on its behalf. Section 55 of the Act also empowers the Plaintiff/Respondent to bring forfeiture proceedings and provides for the procedure for so doing. The proceedings in all the aforestated sections are civil in nature.  In my considered opinion the above proceedings are not to be confused with the power of a court trying a corruption or economic crime to make compensation orders upon a conviction as provided in Section 54 of the ACECA.  It is my finding therefore that the submission by learned Senior Counsel for the 1st Defendant/Applicant that bringing this suit when there is yet to be a conviction is, with utmost due respect, misconceived as it is clear from the wording of Sections 51, 52 and 53 that compensation recovery proceedings can be instituted independent of a conviction. Learned Counsel for the Plaintiff/Respondent cited a number of cases that support this view and whose findings I fully agree with. In the Jamaicain case Between the Assets Recovery Agency and Andrene Samantha Rowe and three others SC Judicature Jamaica Civil Division claim No 2012 HCV 02120, the court stated:",
            "“….There is no need for Assets Recovery Agency to prove the particulars as would be required in a criminal prosecution.  It was held by Sullivan J in Director of the Assets Recovery Agency Vs Green [2005] EWHC 3168 (ADMIN), under similar legislation in England, that the director need not prove or allege the commission of any specific criminal offence.  This position applies equally to the legislation in Jamaica. In addition there is the case of Serious Organised Crime Agency Gale [2009] EWHC 1015; [2010] Lloyd’s Rep FC 39 where Griffith Williams J held that notwithstanding the discontinuance of criminal proceedings in Spain and the defendant’s acquittal in Portugal, it was permissible to proceed with the civil recovery application in the United Kingdom. Griffith Williams J granted the order.  It was upheld by the Court of Appeal [2010] 1WLR 2881 and the House of Lords [2011] 1 WLR 2760; [2012] 2 ALL ERI.  The Court of Appeal expressly stated that in deciding whether the matters alleged constituted unlawful conduct when a civil recovery order is being made is to be decided on a balance of probability.",
            "……It was also pointed out that the civil recovery proceeding is directed at the seizure of property and not the conviction of any individual and thus  there was no reason to apply the criminal standard of proof……Assets Recovery Agency need not prove a criminal conviction of anyone. All Assets Recovery Agency has to do is to establish on a balance of probabilities that unlawful conduct occurred and that the property targeted was property obtained through unlawful conduct.”",
            "19. The above case was one of the cases cited with approval in the Kenyan case of Assets Recovery Agency Vs James Thuita Nderitu & 6 others [2020] eKLR where the court held:-",
            "“I agree with the sentiments expressed by the courts in the above decisions.  A conviction in criminal trial is not necessary before a suit for recovery of funds or other assets reasonably believed to be proceeds of crime is instituted…..",
            "…….As the outcome of criminal proceedings does not, under the law, have a bearing on forfeiture proceedings, the applicant does not have to await the conclusion of a criminal trial before instituting civil proceedings for recovery of funds or assets reasonably believed to be proceeds of crime.”",
            "20. A similar finding was made in the case of Assets Recovery Agency Vs Lilian Wanja Muthoni t/a Sahara Consultants & 5 others [2020] eKLR. ",
            "21. In the case of Director of Assets Recovery Agency & Others,  Republic versus Green & others[2005] EWHC 3168 the court stated inter alia:-",
            "“……I opine that forfeiture is a fair remedy in this instance as it serves to take away that which was not legitimately acquire without the stigma of criminal conviction.  Criminal forfeiture requires a criminal trial and conviction while civil forfeiture is employed where the subject of inquiry has not been convicted of the underlying criminal offence whether as a result of lack of admissible evidence or a failure to discharge the burden of proof in a criminal trial. See – Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission Vs James Mwathethe Mulawa & another [2017] eKLR”",
            "22. I agree and associate myself with the findings in the above cases that criminal proceedings for corruption offences can run concurrently with civil proceedings for compensation and recovery. Moreover there is also a long line of cases to the effect that the concurrent existence of criminal proceedings and civil proceedings generally would not ipso facto, constitute on abuse of the court process. The said findings flow from the provision of Section 193 A of the Criminal Procedure Code. Learned Senior Counsel for the 1st Defendant/Applicant cited the case of Githunguri Vs Republic [1985] LL3090 but with due respect that case does not come to the aid of the 1st Defendant/Applicant or even the 12th Defendant or indeed any of the Defendants because that case is clearly distinguishable from this case in that there it was obvious that the criminal charges in that case were instituted in bad faith as the state had undertaken not to prosecute the applicant. What we have here are civil proceedings instituted pursuant to the law and there is nothing to demonstrate the allegation by the 1st Defendant/Applicant that the same were brought for an ulterior political motive. I also note that the HCACEC Petition No. 30 of 2019 which challenges the charges in the Chef Magistrate’s Anti-Corruption court is predicated on the violation of the 1st Defendant/Applicant’s rights. There is no probability that were the Plaintiff/Respondent to succeed in this case the judgment would impact negatively any decision made in favour of the 1st Defendant/Applicant in the petition. This is because as I have demonstrated above the criminal proceedings and the civil proceedings are distinct. The criminal proceedings are aimed at the accused person in the case while the civil proceedings are aimed at the property that is alleged to have been corruptly acquired and the Plaintiff/Respondent could still succeed in the civil proceedings even if the criminal proceedings collapse. (See also the case of NDPP Vs Prophet (5926/01) (2003) 2AWCHC 16).",
            "23. It is also my finding that the case of Chiumia Vs Southern Bottlers Ltd [1990] 13 MLR 114 (HC) cited by learned Senior Counsel for the applicant is distinguishable from the present case as the issue in that case did not touch on corruptly acquired property recoverable under the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act. The cases I referred to earlier fit squarely in the circumstances of this case and wholly support my finding that the nature and circumstances of this case are such that it can co-exist with the criminal case facing the Defendants and the petition challenging those proceedings. I am therefore unable to find that this case is an abuse of the court process or even that it is in the public interest to stay it or to strike it out. No reasons have been demonstrated to warrant me to so find. In the upshot I find no merit in the application and it is dismissed. Costs shall be in the cause.",

            "\t1. I am invited to determine a Motion by the petitioner dated 28th December 2017, essentially seeking the scrutiny and recount of the ballots cast in the gubernatorial election for Embu County held on 8th August 2017, scrutiny of various electoral materials, re-tallying of ballots in respect of Gategi Primary School Stream 1, among other prayers. The petitioner would like the exercise of scrutiny and recount to be conducted with respect to all the polling stations within Embu County, but he has specified certain polling stations as of being of significant interest.",
            "\t2. The grounds upon which the application is premised are set out on the face of the application. It is stated that the 3rd respondent was declared winner by garnering 985 more votes than the petitioner, the Forms 37A placed on record by the 2nd respondent as the ones used to declare the results had discernible errors on the face of the said documents and the same cannot therefore be ascertained and deemed as the results for the election. The forms of several polling stations are identified as having issues relating to either cancellation, alterations, among other concerns. It is also stated that there were discrepancies in the transposition of results from Forms 37A to Form 37B, with the outcome that the candidates were prejudiced and an examination of the discrepancies could alter the final result. It is argued that the said results cannot be ascertained and deemed to be the result for the gubernatorial election. The polling stations affected have been listed. It stated further that there was a variance of over ten thousand (10, 000) votes in the total votes cast in elections conducted in Embu County for the position of Governor and that of Woman Representative and Senator, and a case is made for scrutiny of the electoral materials to account for the variance. The polling stations where the alleged variances occurred are listed. It is also alleged that some polling stations posted similar results with neighbouring polling stations and in respect of some the forms released to the petitioner’s agents were unstamped, with the suggestion that the results for those polling stations cannot be ascertained. The petitioner swore an affidavit on 28th December 2017, along similar lines. He asserts that all the issues that are highlighted in the application seriously prejudiced him and affected his results. He avers that he has made a case for the orders sought, so that it can be ascertained as to whether the elections were fair, free, credible, transparent, verifiable and accountable, and were conducted in line with the constitutional principles enunciated in Articles 1, 2, 3, 10, 38, 81 and 86 of the Constitution.",
            "\t3. The 1st and 2nd respondents replied to the application through an affidavit sworn on 8th January 2018 by the 2nd respondent. Their case is that sufficient basis has not been laid for the orders sought, and  they accuse the petitioner of venturing on a fishing expedition. For the re-tally of the ballots cast at Gategi Primary School, they argue that that issue should not arise as there was no tally in the first place, and in any event the error at that polling station was admitted but did not affect the overall result. They further state that the petitioner can only rely on the documents that he filed in court, and should not be allowed to rely on the documents that they themselves filed in court. They further state that the petitioner ought to be bound by his pleadings which do not raise the issues of alteration of forms and declaration of altered results. They concede that there were discrepancies between the results entered in Forms 37A and Forms 37B, but say that the said discrepancies were explained by their witnesses and affected all the candidates, and attributed the errors to fatigue and disruptions by the petitioner. They further state that the alterations alleged on Forms 37A were not in fact alterations, but re-pressing of digits to make the numbers more visible. They add that no numbers were altered, and where there was correction of clerical errors the same were countersigned by the election officials in the presence of the candidates’ agents. On agents, they state that failure by agents to sign forms did not affect the validity of the results. They explain that the forms given to the agents could have been faint or illegible as they were produced by carbon copy. It also stated that the variance between the results for the elections for the Governor, Senator and Woman Representative was attributable to stray ballots. On the results of polling stations located in the same premises being the same or similar, it is argued that the same is not strange, and that that should not be a basis for ordering scrutiny and recount.",
            "\t4. The 3rd respondent swore an affidavit on 9th January 2018 in response. He concedes that there may have been errors and unintended mistakes in the transposition of the results from Forms 37A to Forms 37B, but asserts that such errors did not affect the final result. He further states that the petitioner did not lead any evidence on any improper counting. He avers that the petitioner did not take advantage of Regulation 80 of the Elections (General) Regulations to request for recounts at the polling stations, and therefore he should be estopped from calling for a recount at this stage. He emphasises that the results in Forms 37A are final, and the results of the election are ascertainable from the said forms. On the alleged alterations, he states that the petitioner should not offer parole evidence therefor; instead he should have relied on expert evidence to prove the alterations. On fake agents, he avers that the issue was disproved during trial. On the variance between the votes of the different positions, he states the same unnecessarily stretches the boundaries of the petition to touch on other elections. On the KIEMS Kits, he avers that no evidence was led on this. On similarity of results from neighbouring polling stations, he pleads that the same can be resolved by reference to the Forms 37A of the polling stations in question. His other substantial argument is that scrutiny and recount should not be permitted as the electoral materials were fundamentally interfered with by the petitioner after he got orders to preserve them.",
            "\t5. The 4th respondent did not file a reply to the application.",
            "\t6. Both sides filed bundles of the authorities that they sought to rely on. These include Apungu Arthur Kibira vs. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 2 others  Kakamega High Court Election Petition No. 6 of 2017, Suleiman Said Shahbal vs. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 3 others (2013) eKLR, Civil Appeals Nos. 5710 of 2017 Arikala Naras Reddy vs. Venkata Ram Reddy Reddygari & another, Gatirau Peter Munya vs. Dickson Mwenda Kithinji & 2 others (2014)eKLR, George Mbogo Ochilo Ayako vs. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 2 others (2017) eKLR, Jackton Nyanungo Ranguma vs. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (2017) eKLR, Peter Gichuki King’ara vs. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 2 others (2013) eKLR, Chris Munga N.

            "\t7. The Motion was argued orally on 10th January 2018. Mr Nyamu stated the case for the petitioner, while Mr Ngige urged the case for the 1st and 2nd respondents. Mr Ahmednassir Abdullahi presented the case for the 3rd respondent, and Mrs Rugaita for the 4th respondent adopted the arguments of counsel for the 3rd respondent. Counsel addressed me extensively on the matters averred in the affidavits of the parties that they represent and pointed me to the law as stated in the authorities that they relied on.  ",
            "\t8. The law on scrutiny and recount is set out in the Elections Act (No. 24 of 2011) at sections 80(4)(a) and 82 and in  the Elections (Parliamentary and County Elections) Petitions Rules, 2017 at Rules 28 and 29. The terms ‘scrutiny’ and ‘recount,’ although often used interchangeably, refer to different exercises. Recount, according to the court in Justus Gesito Mugali M’Mbaya vs.  Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 2 others Kakamega Election Petition No. 6 of 2013, is limited to establishing the number of votes garnered by the candidates in an election and the tallying of such votes. It is provided for in section 80(4) (a) of the Elections Act and Rule 28 of the Elections (Parliamentary and County Elections) Petitions Rules, 2017. The effect of the two provisions is that a petitioner may apply for a recount or examination of the tallying of the votes and the election court may, upon a winner being apparent from the recount, direct the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to issue such winner with a certificate of election. Scrutiny on the other hand goes beyond recount and tallying, and extends to deal with the question of validity of the votes. Scrutiny, often, includes a recount of the votes. Scrutiny is provided for in section 82 of the Elections Act and 29 of the Elections (Parliamentary and County Elections) Petitions Rules, 2017. The effect of these provisions is that an election court may, suo moto or on application, order scrutiny in the course of the hearing of a petition and the same may be carried out in such manner as the court may direct under the supervision of the Deputy Registrar. The provisions also delineate the votes which may be struck out during scrutiny. It was said in Sammy Kemboi Kipkeu vs. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 2 others (2017) eKLR, that scrutiny is intended to interrogate fully any malfeasances, irregularities and breaches of electoral law.  It was also said that it assists the court deal with disputed votes or tallies. Rule 29 goes on to provide that scrutiny and recount are to be confined to particular polling stations in which the results are disputed and the same may include examination of the election materials specified in that provision.",
            "\t9. The Supreme Court has, in Gatirau Peter Munya vs. Dickson Mwenda Kithinji & 2 others, given guiding principles on applications for scrutiny and recount, which in effect is a summary of the law as is stated in in the Elections Act, No. 24 of 2011, at sections 80(4)(a) and 82, as read with Rules 28 and 29 of the Elections (Parliamentary and County Elections) Petitions Rules, 2017. The said guidelines can be summarised as follows –",
            "\t(a) That any party to the election petition is entitled to make a request for a recount and/or scrutiny of votes at any stage after the filing of the petition and before determination thereof;",
            "\t(b) That the trial court is vested with discretion under section 82(1) of the Elections Act, to make an order for recount or scrutiny of votes either on its own motion or on application for reasons to be recorded;",
            "\t(c) That the right to scrutiny or recount does not lie as a matter of course and the party making the application must establish a basis for such a request from the pleadings, affidavits and recorded evidence; and",
            "\t(d) That the scrutiny or recount is to be conducted in specified polling stations in respect of which the results are disputed or the validity of the vote is called into question.",
            "\t10. The general rule is that the party seeking scrutiny or recount must establish a basis for grant of the order, however there are exceptions. It was held, in Charles Ong’ondo Were vs. Joseph Oyugi Magwanga & 3 others Homa Bay Election High Court Petition No. 1 of 2013, that such an order may be made without establishing a basis where the margin of victory or loss is narrow. It was further stated that the narrower the margin the higher the likelihood that the court would order scrutiny or recount without requiring that the applicant establishes a basis for it. There is also the decision in Hassan Ali Joho vs. Hothan Nyange & another Mombasa High Court Election Petition No. 1 of 2005, to the effect that even where margins are wide and the election court is satisfied that the scrutiny or recount would facilitate an expeditious disposal of the election petition it can still order scrutiny and recount without requiring that a basis be laid for it. It was held in Richard Kalembe Ndile & another vs. Patrick Musimba Mweu & 2 others Machakos High Court Election Petitions Nos. 1 and 7 of 2013 that scrutiny or recount may be ordered where there are numerous errors, alterations or omissions on the relevant election results forms.",
            "\t11. Having perused all the pleadings, heard the parties’ witnesses and having perused all the documents presented in court, I shall proceed to determine the Motion on the foundation of the guiding principles that I have cited above.",
            "\t12. The petition seeks two principal orders that are relevant to the Motion before me: that is to say a re-tally of the votes cast in Gategi Primary School Polling Station Stream 1 and New Site Market Polling Station in Mbeere South Constituency, and a scrutiny and recount of the ballots cast in all polling stations within Runyenjes and Manyatta Constituencies, and more particularly those listed in that prayer in the petition. The body of the petition and the affidavits sworn in support carry details of the alleged malfeasance that purportedly tainted the election according to the petitioner. The alleged acts and omissions are detailed in paragraphs 101 to 113 of the petition. It is, for example, alleged at paragraph 101A that results were inflated in favour of the 3rd respondent in fifteen polling stations listed therein, being Kamiu Primary School, St Andrews Primary School, Karau Primary School, District Public Works Majimbo, Embu Urban Primary School Stream 4, Embu Municipal Stadium, Embu County Primary School, Kianjokoma Primary School Stream 1, Muchagori Primary School Stream 1, Gichera Primary School Stream 1, Kanduri Primary School, Ena Primary School, Kagaari Primary School Stream 1, Mwenendega Primary School Stream 1 and Gategi Primary School. In paragraph 101B of the petition it is alleged that that there was swapping of results with the consequence that what was reported and submitted differed from the true position as reflected in Embu County Primary School, Kathangari Nursery School, Kivangua Coffee Factory, Ngimari Primary School, Kamiu Primary School, Kithunguriri Tea Buying Centre and New Site Market polling stations. It is alleged in paragraph 101C that some results were doctored and fraudulent, with the polling stations alleged to have been affected being Kithegi Coffee Factory, District Public Works Majimbo, Kianjokoma Primary School Stream 1, Ena Primary School Stream 3 and Gategi Primary School Stream 1.",
            "\t13. From the evidence recorded from the witnesses it emerged that there were errors that resulted in candidates being attributed results that exceeded what they had actually garnered according to Forms 37A and cases where some candidates lost votes. The polling stations where these errors were noted include Kithunguriri Tea Buying Centre, Embu County Primary School, Gategi Primary School Stream 1, Karau Primary School, Embu Municipal Stadium, St Andrews Primary School, Kivangua Coffee Factory, Kamviu Primary School, Kathangari Nursery School, Mikimbi Full Gospel Church, Nthambo Primary School, Marimari Primary School, Munyori Primary School, Kamutwanjiru, New Site Market, Kaweru, Ugweri Stream 3, Igumo Catholic Church Grounds and Gichera. The election officials who testified conceded to those errors, and according to them, the petitioner, from the errors identified, lost some 234 votes in five polling stations, while the 3rd respondent was said to have lost some 273 votes in three polling stations and had extra 733 votes attributed to him from seven polling stations. It also emerged that a third candidate lost 358 votes in three polling stations and had 33 extra votes awarded to him in one station. All these errors arose from the tallying process. The election officials attributed their errors to fatigue, explaining that they had to deal with six elections on the same day and the votes for the gubernatorial elections were the last of the six to be counted, tallied and results declared. The 3rd respondent also conceded to those errors, but argued that the same did not affect the overall result.",
            "\t14. There are also averments in the petition concerning doctored results and amended or altered figures. In others it was alleged that the forms were not stamped. Evidence was led on this, and the petitioner pointed out what he described as alterations made to Forms 37A for the following stations listed in his papers, that is to say Kairuri, Githangare, Ndatu Catholic Church grounds, Thikima Coffee Factory, Kauga Tea Buying Centre, Itabua, Kimangaru Stream 1, Water Project Offices, Embu Urban, Embu Municipal Stadium Stream 4, Jua Kali offices grounds, Kathunga, Runyenjes Municipal Hall, among others. The election officials who testified denied altering any documents, and when the Forms 37A lodged on record by the 2nd respondent were placed before them, especially to the returning officer for Manyatta Constituency, Faith Mugo, it was stated that there were overwrites to emphasize the figures, but otherwise the figures had not been interfered with. I have perused through the entire bundle of Forms 37A and noted overwrites and alterations, some of which are countersigned. The forms are carbon copies, and not original. It was argued for the 3rd respondent that there has been no strict proof of the alterations.",
            "\t15. There is also the issue of many neighbouring polling stations returning similar results for all or most of the candidates. The petitioner pointed at the results from Karau, Embu Urban, Munyori, Kanjeru, Ugweri Streams 1 and 2, Kirigi, Kamiu, Gatunduri, Ndumari, Rukwiri, Ng’utu, Kanothu, Kavengero and Ciagara polling stations as some of the centres which returned similar results. The petitioner argued that statistically that raised suspicion and asserted that statistics do not work that way. The respondents’ response to this was that there was nothing untoward about that. The other grounds advanced in the petition relate to the agents for the petitioner or his political party. It is alleged that there were fake agents who signed Form 37A at the polling stations, purporting to be the petitioner’s agents. It is also claimed that the petitioner’s legitimate agents were intimidated, denied opportunity to witness the vote counting and tallying, and that they were not given an opportunity to sign Form 37A or were denied a copy thereof, among other allegations. Several agents testified. Some stated that the whole exercise went smoothly and they were able to participate in the vote counting and to sign the necessary forms. Some claimed to have been denied opportunity to sign the forms or to be given copies thereof. Generally, however, the petitioner was not, in my view, able to demonstrate that his agents were intimidated or ill-treated or even denied the opportunity to be present at vote counting.",
            "\t16. The other ground is that the votes for the gubernatorial election far exceeded those cast for other positions, particularly for Senator and Women Representative positions, which, it was averred, ought to be a matter that should raise suspicion. The petitioner did not file the final results from the Senator’s election, but filed one from the Woman Representative election out of time and without leave of court, and the same was struck out. However, during cross-examination, the 2nd respondent conceded that it was indeed true that the final results for the gubernatorial election exceed the total votes cast in the Woman Representative election by over 10 000 votes. He attributed this to stray votes. During submissions, I was urged not to take this ground seriously as the petitioner had not filed any evidence to support this assertion, and further that the material he sought to rely on had not been filed in court by him and that he could only rely on his own material. That is a correct statement of the law as it is. However, the court cannot turn a blind eye to material that is on record and which can aid it in determining the matter one way or the other.",
            "\t17. The margin between the winning candidate and the runner-up according to the declared results was 985 votes. From the oral evidence of the elections officials at the hearing that margin came down from 985 to 299 votes or thereabout. Guided by the law on recount and scrutiny in cases where the margin of difference between the result of the declared winner and the runner-up is very close or narrow or small – as stated in such cases as Charles Ong’ondo Were vs. Joseph Oyugi Magwanga & 3 others, Richard Kalembe Ndile & another vs. Patrick Musimba Mweu & 2 others and Hassan Ali Joho vs. Hothan Nyange & another - it is my finding that there is sufficient basis for ordering scrutiny and recount in the polling stations set out in the prayers in the petition. The spirit of Rule 28 of the Elections (Parliamentary and County Elections) Petitions Rules, 2017 in my understanding is that where the petition is essentially about the count or tallying, such as in the present case, the petitioner would be justified to apply for recount or for examination of the tallying, and from the authorities above the petitioner need not have to lay basis for a recount where the difference between the votes garnered by the winner and the runner-up is very narrow, as is the case herein. From the pleadings and the oral testimony, it has emerged that the petition herein is more about the number of votes garnered by the candidates, and less about the validity of the ballots themselves. It has been demonstrated from the material on record that the margin of victory has narrowed considerably, and that should be reason enough to examine the materials afresh for the court to be satisfied as to what the candidates actually garnered in the polling stations in dispute. Where the outcome is as close as is the case in this matter the logical thing should be to recount the ballots and revisit the tally. That should take care of prayers 2 and 3 of the Motion.",
            "\t18. The 3rd respondent informed the court that he had no problem with an order for a scrutiny of the Forms 37A, 37B and 37C for the purpose of re-tallying; but was vehemently opposed to a recount. He argued that the electoral materials had been interfered with during the exercise that the petitioner undertook in execution of the orders that he had obtained herein in August 2017. Evidence was led on that aspect of the matter, and it is an issue that I will have to determine in the final judgment. I have, however, taken into account the evidence of the election officials on the matter. I can only observe that during recount the Deputy Registrar would take note of the state of the ballot boxes and the materials held in them. That should no doubt aid in the final determination with respect to that aspect of the matter.",
            "\t19. Regarding prayer 4, on the re-tallying of the votes cast in relation to Gategi Primary School Stream 1, I would agree with the  respondents that the question of re-tallying should not arise. It was conceded that the 3rd respondent was wrongly awarded 400 extra votes at this polling centre. The best approach to this would be to have the votes recounted and thereafter the results for Mbeere South re-tallied to accommodate the outcome of the recount. Prayer 5 is on the Secure Digital Memory (SD) Cards for the KIEMS Kits used in that election. No evidence was laid with regard to the SD cards and KIEMS Kits generally, and therefore no basis whatsoever was laid for grant of this prayer. I shall therefore make no order relating to the same.",
            "\t20. The final orders that I shall make in the circumstances are as follows-",

I have considered the submissions by the parties as regards the Preliminary Objection.  The Plaintiff argues that the application dated 2nd March, 2021 was brought under Provisions of Order 45 Rule (6) of the Civil Procedure Rules which deals with review and that since the Defendant is seeking for stay of execution pending appeal, the application should therefore be struck out and that in any case, the application was filed after inordinate delay.",
            "4. The Plaintiff argues that it cannot be assumed that the citing of wrong Provisions of the Law was a typing error and that the Defendant should have applied for amendment.",
            "5. The Defendant argues that the citing of wrong Provisions of Law was a typing error and that the Preliminary Objection is based on a technicality which should be discouraged by the court.",
            "6. In the case of Mukisa Biscuit Manufacturing Company Ltd =vs= West End Distributors Limited [1969] EA, Law JA stated as follows;-",
            "“So far as I am aware a Preliminary Objection consists of a point of law which has been pleaded, or which arises by clear implication out of pleadings and if argued as a preliminary point may dispose of the suit”.",
            "7. I have looked at ground two of the Preliminary Objection by the Plaintiff.  This ground is on delay to file the application dated 2nd March, 2021.  This is not a point of law to qualify to be argued as a Preliminary point of law. The first ground is based on a technicality.  Order 10 (2) of the Civil Procedure Rules Provides that no application shall be defeated on a technicality or for want of form that does not affect the substance of the application.",
            "8. In the instant case it is clear that the Defendant is seeking stay pending appeal and not review.  It is therefore absurd for the Plaintiff to seek dismissal of the application on this ground.  Article 159 of the constitution mandates courts to administer substantive justice as opposed to technicalities.  I therefore find that the Preliminary Objection by the Plaintiff lacks merit.  The same is dismissed with costs to the Defendant.",
            "The First Application",
            "9. The Defendant contends that he has preferred an appeal against the judgment which was delivered on 2nd February, 2021 and that if execution is allowed to proceed, he will be evicted from the suit property which eviction will greatly prejudice him as he lives in the suit property with his family.",
            "10. The Plaintiff opposed the Defendant’s application based on a replying affidavit sworn on 6th April, 2021.  The Plaintiff contends that the Defendant has not demonstrated that he will suffer substantial loss and or that the appeal will be rendered nugatory should execution proceed.  In the alternative the Plaintiff argues that if the court grants stay, the Defendant should be ordered to give security which is equivalent to the value of the suit property.",
            "11. Order 42 Rule (6) of the Civil Procedure Rules gives conditions upon which stay of execution pending appeal can be granted.  First the application has to be filed without unreasonable delay.  Second, the Applicant has to demonstrate that he will suffer substantial loss should stay of execution not be granted.  Third, there has to be security given as may be binding upon the Applicant in the decree.",
            "12. In the instant case, the impugned judgment was delivered on 2nd February, 2021.  This application was filed on 2nd march, 2021.  The court had granted the Defendant 45 days to move out of the suit property.  This explains why he was not in hurry to file the application.  In the circumstances, I find that the application was brought within reasonable time.",
            "13. Demonstration of substantial loss is the cornerstone for grant of stay of execution.  The Defendant herein lives in the suit property.  He was living in it as a caretaker but after the registered owner was murdered, the Plaintiff obtained grant of letters of administration and filed this suit for eviction.",
            "14. The Defendant in his defence tried to claim that the deceased had given him a share of the property as he considered him as one of his sons.  The Defendant has not demonstrated what substantial loss he will suffer if he was evicted.  If he is evicted and he eventually succeeds in his appeal, he will simply move back to the suit property.  His eviction will not render the appeal nugatory.",
            "15. Ordinarily, security for costs is ordered if the Applicant has demonstrated that he will suffer substantial loss.  As the Defendant has not demonstrated substantial loss, I find that the application for stay has no merit.  The same is dismissed with costs to the Plaintiff.",
            "It is so ordered.",
            "The Second Application",
            "16. The Plaintiff contends that when the court granted the Defendant 45 days to vacate the suit premises failing which he be evicted, the court did not direct that Police do assist in the eviction.  The Plaintiff therefore argues that there is need for the OCS Eldoret Central Police Station to oversee the eviction of the Defendant to allow her access the suit property.",
            "17. The Defendant opposed the Plaintiff’s application based on a replying affidavit sworn on 21st July, 2021.  The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff has filed the current application well aware that he had filed the application dated 2nd March, 2021 which is yet to be determined.  He argues that it is unprocedural for an Applicant to file an application to counter another application by the opposite party.  He contends that this application is brought maliciously.",
            "18. I have considered the Plaintiff’s application as well as the opposition thereto by the Defendant.  I have also considered the submissions by the parties.  The only issue for determination is whether this court should order the OCS Eldoret Central Police to oversee the eviction. The judgment was clear that the Plaintiff was to vacate within 45 days failing which eviction was to issue.  The 45 days given have since lapsed.  The Defendant has not vacated.  His application for stay pending appeal has been dismissed.  The Plaintiff should enjoy the fruits of her judgment.  I therefore find that the Plaintiff’s application has merits.  I allow the same with the result that the OCS Eldoret Central Police Station is hereby ordered to oversee the eviction of the Defendant from LR NO.ELDORET MUNICIPALITY/BLOCK.5/733.  the Plaintiff shall have costs of this application.",

            "RULING",
            "Introduction.",
            "1. This is a ruling in respect of two separate applications. The first application is dated 5th March 2015. It is brought by the Plaintiff and it seeks the following orders: -",
            "1. Spent",
            "2. Spent",
            "3. THAT this Honourable Court be pleased to issue a temporary injunction retnining, the Defendants by themselves, their agents and servants from trespassing onto, encroaching erecting or causing to be erected any structure(s) and from alienating or causing to be alienated, selling, disposing, charging and/or in any way whatsoever, dealing with the mat property herein, being all that prime parcel known as LR. No. 209/19473, situated on State House Crescent, within the City of Nairobi, pending the hearing and final determination of this suit.",
            "4. THAT this Honourable Court be pleased to issue a temporary injunction ordering the Defendants by themselves, their agents, servants and proxies to leave, vacate and move out of the suit property herein, being all that prime parcel known as L.R. No. 209/19473 situated on State House Crescent, within the City of Nairobi, pending the bearing and final determination of this suit.",
            "5. THAT the Officer Commanding, Kilimani Police Station, do enforce compliance of this Honourable Court's Orders and ensure order at the suit premises herein being all that prime parcel known as L.R. No. 209/19473, situated on State House Crescent, within the City of Nairobi.",
            "6. THAT the costs of this application be provided for.",
            "2. The 2nd application is dated 11th March 2015. It is brought by Bonventre Tours Travel Limited which seeks to be enjoined in these proceedings as a Plaintiff.",
            "3. The subject matter of this suit relates to a prime property which is at State House Crescent in Nairobi. The Plaintiff/Applicant claims the suit property which is LR No.209/19473. The Applicant in the second application claims the same property under LR No. 209/5581. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) is also seeking to recover the same land in ELC 573 of 2017. The recovery by EACC is being done under LR NO. 209/5581.",
            "The First Application.",
            "4. The Applicant in this application contends that it is the registered owner of LR No. 209/19473. The Applicant purchased this property which was then owned by four individuals and companies. The property was then LR No. 209/5581/2, LR No.209/5581/3, LR No. 209/5581/4 and LR No. 209/5581/15 . The properties were purchased for Kshs.7,500,000/= each making a total of Kshs.30,000,000/= . The purchase was in the year 2005. The Applicant then applied for amalgamation which was approved. The property upon amalgamation became LR No. 209/19473.",
            "5. The Applicant then applied for development approval which was granted. The Applicant intended to put up residential apartments. In 2015, 1st Defendant raided the property on grounds that she was recovering grabbed government land. The Applicant contends that the 1st Defendant later returned with a private contractor who deposited building materials.",
            "6. The Applicant’s application was not opposed by the Respondents.",
            "Analysis.",
            "7. Even though the application was not opposed, I am under obligation to be satisfied that the Applicant has established a prima facie case to warrant grant of an injunction. While giving the introduction, hereinabove, I stated that this property is being claimed by three parties. EACC is claiming it on grounds that the property was owned by Nairobi City Council which irregularly sold it out to the Applicant in the second application.",
            "8. There is even an application by the Applicant to have this suit consolidated with ELC 573 of 2017. There is also another suit where the Applicant in the second application is fighting over ownership of the property with among others, the Applicant in this case. The Applicant is not on the ground having been ejected in 2015. Given the circumstances, the Applicant cannot be ordered to get back into the suit property. The best order to be made in the circumstances is that the status quo should be maintained until the dispute herein is heard and determined.",
            "Disposition.",
            "9. I grant an order of maintenance of the status quo which should last until the dispute in this case is resolved. The costs of this application shall be in the cause.",
            "It is so ordered.",
            "The second application.",
            "10.The Applicant in this application contends that it is the registered owner of LR No. 209/5581. The Applicant purchased this property from Nairobi City Council vide a transfer which was registered on 10th August 1992. The Applicant then took possession and constructed a perimeter wall around the property. It put up a site house.",
            "11. The Applicant then applied for subdivision of the property. The subdivision was approved but no titles came out. The Applicant contends that it has the original title in its possession. Sometime in 2013, some individuals visited the property and claimed ownership, demolished the perimeter fence and chased away its workers.",
            "12. The Applicant proceed to conduct investigations which revealed that the suit property had been subdivided into five titles namely LR No. 209/5581/1, LR No.209/5581/2, LR 209/5581/3, LR 209/5581/4 and LR No. 209/5581/5 which were given to individuals and companies. The new titles were then transferred to the Applicant in the first application which proceeded to amalgamate the titles into LR No. 209/19473.",
            "13. The Applicant proceeded to file ELC 794 of 2003 against 9 Defendants. This suit was later withdrawn and the Applicant filed ELC 97 of 2007 whose proceedings are said to be pending determination in the Court of Appeal.",
            "14. This application has been pending determination for over six years. There is no evidence that any party filed either grounds of opposition or replying affidavit in opposition to this application. When this matter came before me on 29th June 2021, counsel for the Applicant in the first application informed the court t  hat they were yet to get instruction from their client on whether to oppose the application. The Respondents were given seven days within which to file written submissions. As at 24th August 2021 when I was writing this ruling, no Respondent had filed submissions.",
            "15. I have considered the Applicant’s submissions which are dated 11th May 2021. I notice that the Applicant has mentioned that the Applicant in the first application filed a replying affidavit sworn by Hailu Asfaw Menhesha. That affidavit is not in the file. As the counsel for the Applicant in the first application seems not to be aware of any affidavit, it is safe to assume that none was filed. Be that as it may the issue for determination is whether the Applicant has demonstrated that it should be enjoined in these proceedings.",
            "16. The Applicant has provided a copy of transfer registered on 10th August 1992 in its favour. The subdivisions which were purchased by the Applicant in the first application were registered in 2003. The Applicant in the first application then purchased all the subdivisions in 2005 and later on amalgamated. It is therefore clear that the Applicant in this application has demonstrated that it has a stake in this property for it to be enjoined in this suit. Indeed, there are other proceedings where the Applicant is fighting over the same property with the Applicant in the first application. I therefore find that the Notice of Motion dated 11th March 2015 is well merited . I allow the same with the result that the Applicant is enjoined in the proceedings as the 2nd Plaintiff. The pleadings herein should be served upon it and it is at liberty to file its documents in this matter within 14 days. Costs shall be in the cause.",
            "It is so ordered.",
            "17. In summary thereof, I grant an order of maintainance of status quo  in respect of the notice of motion dated 5th March 2015. Costs shall be in the cause. I allow joinder of the Applicant in the second application as a second Plaintiff. Pleadings to be served upon the added Plaintiff which shall file its pleadings within 14 days from the date of this Ruling.",

It is the applicant’s contention that judgement was delivered in favour of the respondent on 19/9/2019; that his Counsel requested for proceedings to enable him prefer an appeal; that the proceedings were certified on 25/3/2021; that his Counsel filed a notice of appeal; that in the year 2020, he had a case in Tanzania and was held there for one year; that it is on this basis that the applicant seeks to lodge an appeal out of time; that he shall suffer loss if the intended appeal is not allowed to be filed out of time; that the intended appeal has high chances of success; that this application has been filed timeously and the intended appeal shall be rendered  nugatory if this application is not allowed.",
            "The application was opposed. The respondent filed grounds of opposition dated 2/7/2021. The respondent argued:-",

            "iv. That the subject matter of the suit has already been condemned by the respondent in accordance with Section 216 (4) (a) and Section 217 (a) of the East Africa Community Customs Management Act, 2004 and therefore Order number 2 and 5 of the application have been overtaken by events.

            "“In our view section 7, above, should be given a construction which would obviate ridiculous result. The intention of the Legislature in enacting section 7, above, clearly appears to us to be that it can only be used and more specifically the very first time the intending appellant manifests his intention to appeal. It is for this reason that we agree with the remarks of Bosire Ag, JA (as he then was) in the case of Edward Allan Robinson & 2 others vs Philip Gikaria Muthami, (Civil Application No Nai 187 of 1997) (unreported), where he remarked, in pertinent part, thus:",
            "‘Section 7, above was not, in my view, intended to cover appellants whose appeals have been struck out for incompetence and who desire to file competent appeals. Once a litigant files a valid notice of appeal and had obtained the necessary leave to appeal, where necessary, the matter respecting which an appeal is intended, is thereby removed from the jurisdiction of the superior court, except for limited matters in which specific jurisdiction has been conferred on it to deal with. Section 7, above, presupposes that an intending appellant has not taken any other steps in pursuance of that appeal.’",
            "In the persuasive decision by J. Odunga in Nyamodi  Ochieng Nyamogo =vs= Telkom Kenya Ltd Nairobi  HCC 1736  of 1993 the judge said: ",

            "The question is whether the applicants have satisfied the court that time should be extended for them to file notice of appeal.  ",
            "The powers donated to the High Court under Section 7 of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act are clear and limited. This court can only come to the aid of a litigant who is desirous of filing a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal for the first time and has run out of the stipulated timelines. In his supporting affidavit, the applicant has annexed and marked ‘TMM4’ being a notice of appeal filed pursuant to Rule 75 of the Court of Appeal Rules.  According to Rule 75 (1) and (2) of the Court of Appeal Rules 2010, a person who desires to appeal in the Court of Appeal shall give notice in writing to be lodged within fourteen (14) days of the date of the decision against which it is desired to Appeal.   The judgment herein was delivered on 19/9/2019 and the notice of appeal was filed on 3/10/2019 which was within fourteen (14) days allowed for filing the notice of appeal.  The respondent challenges its competence since it was not served upon  as required under Rule 77 (1) of the Court of Appeal Rules. In my view, this is a question which only the Court of Appeal can handle.  Otherwise, notice is already filed and there would be no question of this court granting leave to file.",
            "Even if the question was not on the competence of the notice of appeal, already this court was devoid of jurisdiction to entertain any application to extend time   once an action has been taken by the applicant by the filing the notice of appeal,  as regards the prayer, that is, that the applicant be allowed to file and serve the appeal out of time. Any other question on the intended appeal can only be handled by the Court of Appeal pursuant to Rule 4 of the Court of Appeal Rules.",
            "The powers to enlarge time is discretionary and must be exercised judiciously.   It is upon the applicant to convince the court that there was good reason for failure to comply with the timelines.",
            "Principles that guide the court in the exercise of its mandate to extend time were clearly set out in the Supreme Court decision of Nicholas Kiptoo Arap Korir Salat =vs= IEBC & 7 OTHERS (2013)eKLR where the court  said:",
            "“extension of time is not a right of a party. It is an equitable remedy that is only available to a deserving party at the discretion of the court; a party who seeks for extension of time has the burden of laying a basis to the satisfaction of the court; whether the Court should exercise the discretion to extend time, is a consideration to be made on a case to case basis; whether there is reasonable reason for the delay. The delay should be explained to the satisfaction of the court; whether there will be any prejudice suffered by the respondent of the extension is granted; whether the application has been brought without undue delay; and whether uncertain cases, like election petition, public interests should be a consideration for extending time.",
            "The applicant explained the failure to file the appeal in time to be because he was in prison in Tanzania in 2020.   He attached the court proceedings until 13/5/2021 from Tanzania Court dated 20/3/2019 to 25/9/2020.  However, this application was not filed no explanation was given to this court as to why this application was not made soon after the applicant’s release on 25/9/2020.   Seven months delay after his release, with the knowledge that there was already  a delay from September, 2019, was inordinate and an unexplained delay.  In my view the applicant was indolent.",
            "As to the suggestion that there was a delay in availability of the court  proceedings, the applicant had counsel on record.   There is no evidence that the counsel applied for the proceedings at any given time.   There is no certificate of delay issued by the Executive Officer or the Deputy Registrar.   In any case, the High Court issues a typed judgment and there would be no reason to delay the filing of an  appeal as one awaits  the typing of proceedings.   Even if notice of appeal had not been filed,  the applicant would not have been deserving of leave to file appeal out of time.",
            "On the second prayer,  the respondent contended that the subject motor vehicle has already been condemned in accordance with Section 216 (4) and Section 217 (2) (a) of the East African Community Customs Management Act, 2004.   The said sections provide for  failure and condemnation of anything which is the subject of proceedings under the Act.  After condemnation, it may be disposed of, sold or destroyed as the case may be.  The applicant did not file a further affidavit to controvert this position. It therefore goes without saying that the prayer for stay and preservation of the subject motor vehicle pending the hearing and determination of the intended appeal has been overtaken by events. Stay and preservation orders cannot be issued in vain.",
            "In the end, I make the following order: -",

            "1. …Spent",
            "2. …Spent",
            "3. That this honorable court be pleased to order a stay of execution of the ruling and order made in Molo Chief Magistrate’s Court (Civil Division) No. 77 of 1993 on the 3rd day of August 2021 by Hon. E.G Nderitu pending the hearing and final determination of the applicant’s appeal.",

            "2. The application is supported by the affidavit sworn by the appellant on 17/08/2021. The grounds on the face of the application and the supporting affidavit are that a ruling was delivered on 3/08/2021 by Hon. E.G. Nderitu which allowed the respondent’s application and issued eviction orders against the applicant in execution of a decree that is over twenty years old; that the eviction orders were issued without due regard to the provisions of Order 22 Rule 18 of the Civil Procedure Rules; that as a result of that ruling the respondent has started fencing the subject suit land plot No. 21 Tayari Farm Molo; that the respondent has now intruded on the applicant’s parcel of land and uprooted and destroyed trees incurring great loss; that his family has been in occupation of the suit land for many decades; that the judgement in that matter was delivered on 16/06/2000 and the respondents did not execute the judgement until twenty one years later; the appellant prays that his application for stay of execution be granted.",
            "Response",
            "3. The respondent filed a replying affidavit sworn on 26/08/2021 and filed on 30/08/2021. She deposed that her late husband instituted a claim against the appellant herein and judgement entered in his favor on 16/06/2000; that the appellant then filed HCCA No. 71 of 2000 and obtained stay of execution of that judgement; that the appeal was dismissed on 28/04/2010; that on 13/05/2010 the appellant filed Molo SPMCC No. 263 of 2010 which was heard and dismissed on 05/04/2016; that the appellant failed to vacate the suit property as ordered by the court in its judgement and so the respondent filed the application dated 22.03.2021 seeking orders of eviction of the appellant herein; that the appellant filed a preliminary objection dated 05.04.2021 which was dismissed on 3.08.2021 and the respondent’s application allowed; that the eviction was carried out before this application was filed and therefore it is overtaken by events.",
            "Submissions",

            "Determination.",
            "5. The only issue for determination is whether the court should grant stay of execution of the ruling and order delivered and issued on 03/08/2021 in the Molo Chief Magistrate’s court in Molo CM Case No. 77 of 1993.",
            "6. Order 42 Rule 6(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules provides as follows:-",
            "(2) No order for stay of execution shall be made under subrule (1) unless—",
            "(a) the court is satisfied that substantial loss may result to the applicant unless the order is made and that the application has been made without unreasonable delay; and",
            "(b) such security as the court orders for the due performance of such decree or order as may ultimately be binding on him has been given by the applicant.",
            "7. The court in the case of RWW vs. EKW [2019] eKLR stated as follows on stay of execution pending appeal:",
            "“The purpose of an application for stay of execution pending an appeal is to preserve the subject matter in dispute so that the rights of the appellant who is exercising the undoubted right of appeal are safeguarded and the appeal if successful, is not rendered nugatory. However, in doing so, the court should weigh this right against the success of a litigant who should not be deprived of the fruits of his/her judgment. The court is also called upon to ensure that no party suffers prejudice that cannot be compensated by an award of costs.",
            "9. Indeed to grant or refuse an application for stay of execution pending appeal is discretionary. The Court when granting the stay however, must balance the interests of the Appellant with those of the Respondent.”",
            "8. For the court to grant stay of execution pending appeal, the applicant will have to satisfy the following three conditions, the applicant has come to court without unreasonable delay, that the applicant stands to suffer substantial loss if the stay order is not granted and give security for due performance of the decree if the appeal fails.",
            "9. In the present application, the appellant is seeking for stay of execution of the order made in Molo Chief Magistrates case No. 77 of 1993 that allowed his eviction from the suit property Plot No. 21 Tayari Farm. The said ruling was delivered on 3.08.2021 and the application was filed on 19.08.2021 and so it was filed without unreasonable delay.",
            "10. In her submissions the respondent avers that the appellant/applicant admits that he has already been evicted from the suit property and so in essence the application has been overtaken by events. A stay order, like an order of injunction can only be issued against an event that has not yet occurred. Issuance of a stay order after the event intended to be barred has occurred is futile.  Has the applicant admitted that he has already been evicted?",
            "11. The appellant avers in his application that the respondent began to invade the suit land and cause destruction even before the extraction of the orders. He further avers that as at the time the order of temporary stay was granted by this court on 20/8/2021 he had not been evicted and that the provisions of Section 152 B 152 C 152 D and 152 E of the land act provides for the lawful procedure that has to be followed before an eviction is carried out. He submits that that law requires that an eviction notice should issue not less than 90 days before the eviction. From the contents of the applicant’s submissions I do not find that the applicant has admitted that he has been evicted from the suit premises.",
            "12. I have examined the replying affidavit of the respondent which exhibits a letter dated 11/8/2021 from the auctioneers said to have effected the eviction of the appellant and the receipt dated 4/8/2021 showing the fees paid in respect of their services by the applicant. She states that the eviction took place even before this appeal was filed. It is noteworthy that there is no supplementary affidavit controverting the respondent’s position and the argument the applicant now raises can not be made in this application after the eviction.  ",
            "13. After due consideration of the matter I find that the plaintiff has been evicted and he does not consider the eviction procedural. However that is not an issue to be dealt with by this court as what is currently before me is only a notice of motion for stay. The issue of whether the execution of the eviction orders was legal or not should be agitated elsewhere and not in this appeal. As I have stated before an order of stay can not be issued to bar an action that has already taken place.",
            "14. The upshot of the foregoing is that the appellant’s application dated 17/8/2021 has been overtaken by events, lacks merit and is hereby dismissed with costs. ",

            "2. Musya Kyai was the grandfather to the petitioners and the objectors herein while Kioko Musya, the deceased herein, was a brother to Yumbu Musya, fathers of the Petitioners and Mutuku Musya and Kiteta Musya, the respective fathers of the Objectors herein.  ",
            "3. By a ruling dated 14th January, 2019, this Court confirmed the grant the subject of this case and direct that the said property being Land Parcel Number Mwala/Kyawango/336 be registered jointly in the names of the Petitioners and the Objectors herein, Nelson Makau Yumbu, Mulei Yumbu, David Mwania and Boniface Kiteta for themselves and in trust for all the beneficiaries of the estate of  Musya Kyai who are Kilove Musya, Musyoki Kioko, Mutisya Kioko, Mwanzia Kioko, Maswili Mutunga, Munywoki Mutunga, Matheka Mutunga, David Musya Mutunga, Bonface Isaac Kiteta,  Ruth Mwalwa, Lucy Wangari, Grace Kavindu, Kinyele Yumbu, Mutua Yumbu, Joseph Muli, Nelson Makau Yumbu, Manga Mutuku, Monicah Nini Mutuku, David Mwania Mutuku, Sila Matheka Mutuku, James Muli Mutuku, Sarah Kavuli Mutuku, Jane Mutungu, Eunice Ndunge, Ndeti Mutuku, Mbuvi Mutuku, Muinde Mutuku, Nzioka Mutuku, Mutisya Munyao, Muia Nzioka, Matata Nzioka and Edward Nzioka Kinyungu.",
            "4. However, on 19th March, 2019, Nelson Makau Yumbu, by Summons dated 25th February, 2019 sought for orders that the resultant Certificate of Confirmation of Grant be revoked and that ruling delivered on 9th October, 2017 by Nyamweya, J (as she then was) be set aside and that the said Applicant be accorded an opportunity of being heard.",
            "5. On 29th July, 2019, the 1st Objector herein, David Mwania Musya, intimated that he also wished to call witnesses and was not objecting to the said summons, the same was allowed and it was directed that the matter be heard de novo. As a result, the parties were directed to file their statements and documents and that the matter be disposed of by way of viva voce evidence.",
            "6. On 21st September, 2020, this Court directed that the order made on 4th November, 2011 consolidating Succession Causes No. 235 of 2009 and 236 of 2009 be set aside and that the testimony be taken in Succession Cause No. 236 of 2009 and that the said testimony would apply to Succession Cause No. 235 of 2009.",
            "7. The 2nd Objector, Boniface Issac Mutinda Kiteta, who was the 1st Objector’s cousin passed away during the pendency of these proceedings. The 2nd Petitioner is similarly deceased. The only asset in both succession causes is the land parcel Mwala/Kyawango/336, which was held by the Deceased herein, Kioko Musya and Kithemba Musya another brother to the deceased herein whose succession cause is the subject matter of the related Succession Cause No. 235 of 2019 as proprietors in common in equal shares (hereinafter referred to as “the suit property”).",
            "8.  After a grant of letters of administration was issued to the Petitioners on 15th June, 2009, they filed a summons for confirmation of grant on 24th March, 2011, in which they proposed that the suit property be registered in their joint names. The Petitioners contended that although the property was registered in the joint names of their uncles Kioko Musya and Kithembe Musya, the same was held in trust for them by virtue of their relationship. They relied on two letters, one from the Euanie clan dated 24th March 1973, and the other of a family meeting held on 5th April 1980, by which they claimed they were given the said land by the said clan and the Objectors’ fathers.",
            "9.  The Objectors thereupon filed an affidavit of protest sworn by the 1st Objector on 9th August 2011, contending that the Petitioners had concealed material facts from the court and failed to disclose all the beneficiaries of the said land, and in particular that the two Deceased Persons had other nephews surviving them.",
            "The Objectors’ Case",
            "10. The Objectors’ case as presented by the 1st Objector was that his official names on his ID Card are David Mwania Musya. He confirmed that the petitioners are his paternal cousins since their father is the fourth born son of Mwikali Musya while his father is the fifth born son of Mwikali Musya.",
            "11. According to him, at the time of the commencement of the land adjudication in August, 1969, Mulei Yumbu was an old man with a wife and three children while Nelson Makau Yumbu was a school teacher married with one child. They therefore had the opportunity during the said exercise to claim their rights hence their claim that their uncles, Kioko Musya and Kithembe Musya registered land parcel No. Mwala/Kyawango/336 in their favour due to their young age is not true. It was averred that Kioko and Kithembe removed registration of the three mothers for their own benefit to hold it for the whole family and not for the benefit of Nelson Makau and Mulei Yumbu.",
            "12. In the process of the adjudication, the larger Musya parcel of land was first subdivided into two equal parts, one for the children of Mwikali Musya and the other for Kivalwa Musya under the supervision of Nelson Makau. The division into only two parts as opposed to three was due to the fact that the first wife had given birth to only daughters, who were all married. However, the portion assigned to the sons of Mwikali was to be subdivided into four equal parts. Kioko’s portion was already given two separate parcels of land which he sold to Mutuku Mbuvi and moved to Kithyoko in Masinga. Kiteta’s land is still owned by his children while Mutuku’s is shared amongst his three wives since their children were young at the time. Yumbu’s was registered in the name of Mumbua Yumbu who is deceased and is registered as Mwala/Kyawango/385. It was therefore the Objectors’ position that Nelson Yumbu is not being truthful by contending that his father never got a share in the larger Musya Kyai ancestral land yet the title was issued in the name of Mumbua Yumbu.",
            "13. According to the Objectors, land parcel No. Mwala/Kyawango/336 used to be a temporary grazing area during drought but was abandoned when Mutunga Musya moved to Masinga. The Objectors asserted that Kioko and Kithembe never cared for the land till the 1st Objector’s father retired from the Colonial Police Force in 1957 when he found that the land had been grabbed by Sila Katumo and Kavivya Nzenge and he claimed it back after giving each of them a goat being mbui ya vuu. When the 1st Objector’s mother got married to Mutuku Musya, she noticed that the larger Musya land was congested and with the first wife of Mutuku, they went and cleared the bush (shown as Zone C) and proceeded to cultivate it and that no other wife of Musya’s sons cultivated it.",
            "14. It was averred that the 1st Objector’s father started clearing the bush so that grass could grow but all of a sudden Kitisya Munywoki who owned Zone A, stopped him from doing so claiming that the land was father’s. The issue was however resolved after the 1st Objector’s father gave him two goats and refunded him his family’s transport expenses to the land he had acquired in Shimba Hills. From then henceforth, the 1st Objector’s father used the said land for the period from 1957 till 1973 when it was under the care of Mutuku’s family till the time the Euani Clan ordered Mulei Yumbu to move into the said land. Mulei was shown the land that belonged to Musya Kyai and he settled in zone B while Mutuku’s family continued utilizing Zone A.",
            "15. According to the Objector’s, during those days, Kitisya Munywoki’s home was on the right hand shown as Zone A while Mutunga Musya had a home for his cows and those of Mutuku Musya. However, none of the other sons of Musya used to take their animals there.",
            "16. When Nelson Makau Yumbu was transferred from Machakos Town to Kyawango Primary School, he visited his brother and found the 1st Objector’s late brother herding cattle in Zone A and ordered him never to return there. According to the 1st Objector, there was a disagreement between him and Makau over Mwala/Kyawango/336 necessitating the 1st Objector to place a caution. Apart from that he further lodged a complaint before Kangundo District Officer who was then acting as 3rd class magistrate. The 1st Objector therefore challenged the petitioners’ contention that they had been in undisturbed occupation of the land for 40 years.",
            "17. According to the Objectors, the property of Musya Kyai was shared among his sons and it did not matter how many wives each of his sons had since it was permissible to allocate ancestral land to the wives.",
            "18. It was the Objectors’ case that their grandfather had several pieces of land. The parcel at Kwa Mulae and Kwa Mai was given to Kioko and was sold by the late Kioko Musya who migrated to Kithyoko where he acquired land. As regards the large Musya land, where Musya dwelt with his three wives, one of his three wives, Mumbua Musya, had only three daughters, Maluki, Kaluu and Mutune who were all married at the time of the land adjudication and were never given land based on Kamba Customary Law. However, Mumbua had a concubine known as Mbula who had a son known as Munguta Musya. The said concubine was however chased away by Kioko and Kithembe and she got married to Musuke who refunded the dowry to Kioko and Kithembe. The second wife of Musya, Mwikali, bore him 5 boys and one girl, namely, Kioko, Mutunga, Kiteta, Yumbu, Mutuku, Katumbi Musya and the daughter, Katumbi, who having got married was similarly not entitled to any land. The third wife had two sons and two daughters, Kithembe, Nzioka, Kaindi and Nthyoma.",
            "19. According to the Objectors, the larger Musya land in Kyawango was sub-divided into two parts, one for the sons of Mwikali and the other for the sons of Kivalwa",
            "20. It was averred that Mutunga’s 6 acres were sold to Mary Kaswii Mutuku which land is now owned by Manga Mutuku though the land retained its original LR No. Mwala/Kyawango/78. Kiteta’s land was registered in his wife’s name, Kavuli as LR No. Mwala/Kyawango/317 while Yumbu’s land was registered in the name of Mumbua Yumbu as LR No. Mwala/Kyawango/385. The said land was to be shared amongst the sons of Yumbu namely, Kinyele Yumbu, Julius Mutua Yumbu, Mulei Yumbu and Nelson Makau Yumbu. The Objector’s father on the other hand had 10 sons. He however got equal share as those of Yumbu, Kiteta and Mutunga and his 10 sons had no complaint.",
            "21. According to the Objector, under the Kamba Customary Law, if a woman dies without having given birth to a son, all her property is divide amongst the other sons of her husband. However, since Makau had sworn an affidavit in which he stated that he was the son of the second wife of Yumbu Musya, he should claim his share from Kinyele Yumbu.",
            "22. It was stated that LR No. Mwala/Kyawango/336 was not Musya’s place of resident but was a temporary grazing area during drought and only Mutunga used to stay there with his cattle and those of his father, Mutuku. According to the Objectors the land was adjacent to the one of Kitisya Munywoki and Mutuku’s family used to manage it as far back as 1939 and even the 1st Objector’s mother had a shamba there. However, Mutuku’s mother migrated to Kithyoko.",
            "23. The 1st Objector referred to the burial programme of Mulei Yumbu, Makau Yumbu’s brother, in which it was disclosed that Mulei was the son of Yumbu Musya, Tabitha Meli and Rael Mumbua and was brother to Nelson Yumbu, Grace Malia, Gideon Kinyele and Julius Mutua. According to the 1st Objector, this is a clear confirmation that Yumbu Musya had two wives. The 1st Objector also referred to a sketch map of LR No. Mwala/Kyawango/336 in which according to him, parts A and C were given to him because they belonged to his late father, Mutuku Musya while part B was to be subdivided to the interested survivors of Musya Kyai.",
            "24. While referring to the letters dated 24th March, 1973 and 5th April, 1980, the 1st Objector stated that since the handwriting in both are identical, it means they were authored by the same person, Nelson Makau and though some names were inserted therein, there were no ID Card Nos and signature hence are of no value.",
            "25. On cross-examination by Mr Ngolya, learned counsel for the petitioners, the 1st Objector insisted that though his ID Card bore the name David Mwania Musya, his name was David Mwania Mutuku and that his father was Mutuku Musya. He explained that his father’s name was not appearing as part of his name in the ID Card but explained that his grandfather was called Musya Kyai who had three wives and he was from the 2nd wife’s house which was the house of Mwikali Musya. He stated that the first wife was Mumbua Musya. Referred to the name Syomutune Musya, he said that he only heard of that name but stated that the third wife was called Kivalwa Musya. According to him Kioko Musya was from the 2nd House from where his father came from while Kithembe Musya was from the 3rd House, Kivalwa’s. The petitioners, Nelson Makau and Mulei are however from Mwikali’s House and not from Mumbua’s House.",
            "26. Referred to a lady called Meme, he denied that she was a concubine (iweto). He however agreed that they hail from Euani Clan and that his grandfather had properties one of which was land in Kyawango in Mwala but also had grazing land in Kamuthambya Area which was initially known as Plot No. 336 part of which belonged to Musya Kyai while the other part belonged to Kitisya Munywoki. According to him, the elders did not distribute the property but were only called to resolve a case.",
            "27. The Objector stated that it was wrongful for the children of Meme to be allocated plot no. 336 since Meme was not Musya’s wife. He stated that Kioko and Kithembe were registered as proprietors later and are currently the registered proprietors thereof. Ladies however could not be registered. The Objector stated that he was not from Kioko’s or Kithembe’s House. He however denied that the families of the deceased recognise Nelson as the owner. He explained that he is objecting on behalf of his father’s house and denied that the families of Kioko and Kithembe confirmed Nelson as the proprietors. Referred to the letter dated 24th March, 1973, he stated that while the same referred to land parcel no. 336, the same was invalid. He however agreed that Mwala/Kyawango/336 is related to Kamuthambya/336 but denied having attended the clan meeting despite the indication that he was present as he was not aware of the same. Also referred to the letter dated 5th April, 1980, he stated that he did not attend despite his name having been inserted therein as David Mutuku. He disclosed that he knew two ladies called Mumbua and that Syomutune was an alias and was not aware that her house was allocated the plot though he heard about it.",
            "28. The 1st Objected stated that his family was residing in Kyawango though on different plots. He insisted that every child of Musya Kyai inherited Musya Kyai’s land and that he was staying on his father’s land and not that of Musya. He however admitted that Mulei, Nelson’s brother had children one of whom was Muli Mulei who was staying on plot 336. The 1st objector however stated that he was staying between Nelson and Muli while Nelson was staying on the land he purchased. He however was not aware if he had land in plot 336. He could not however bar him from staying there if he was authorised by the clan to stay there since he was not in the meeting but was told that he was allocated. According to the 1st Objector he has many brothers and they support him since he represents all of them but admitted that he had no written authority from them. It was his evidence that part of the land was Kitisya’s which his father bought and his family surrendered and left. He however had no problem with Nelson and Mulei being on the same land belonging to Musya since he was only seeking part thereof belonging to his father.",
            "The Petitioners’ Case",
            "29.  According to the 1st Petitioner, their grandfather, Musya Kyai, owned several pieces of ancestral lands in Kyawango Location and another parcel of land near Athi River near Mwala Sub-County. He stated that their said grandfather had three wives, namely, Syomutune, Mwikali and Kivalwa who constituted the tree houses of their said grandfather names as Syomutune, Mwikali and Kivalwa Houses respectively. According to the said Petitioner, the Houses of Mwikali and Kivalwa inherited the parcels in Kyawango while Syomutune House was given the land near Athi River, known as Mwala/Kyawango/336. He disclosed that on 24th March, 1973, Euani Clan convened a meeting where they confirmed that the said land parcel was the property of Syomutune House from which both Petitioners hailed. A similar confirmation was made during a family meeting attended by among others, the 1st Objector herein on 5th April, 1980. It was averred that though the deceased herein and the deceased in Cause No. 235 of 2019 had been registered as proprietors of the suit property, they were holding the same in trust for Syomutune House and had been waiting for the opportune moment to surrender the same to the representatives of the said House. According to the 1st Petitioner, the Petitioners have been in peaceful, open and transparent use, occupation and possession of the suit property for several decades and that all the members of the other houses of their late grandfather are well aware and respect the fact that the House of Syomutune inherited the aid parcel.",
            "30. It was therefore stated that the 1st Objector is simply out to poison and fracture that peaceful and harmonious co-existence in the greater Musya Kyai family yet he belongs to another House that inherited a huge piece of land in Kyawango. According to the 1st Petitioner, by petitioning for letters of administration in the said related causes, the petitioners intended to have the suit land ultimately transmitted to them since the deceased persons held the same in trust for Syomutune House. However, as the 2nd Petitioner is also deceased, the 1st Petitioner sought that the said land be distributed to himself and Joseph Mulei, the son of the 2nd Petitioner, Mulei Yumbu.  ",
            "31. According to the 1st Petitioner, the suit parcel was inherited by himself and his late brother and that the 1st Objector had no interest therein since it was allocated to them as their share of the ancestral land.",
            "32. In cross-examination by the Objector, the 1st Petitioner stated that their grandfather had two parcels of land and that he belonged to the house of Syomutune who was also known as Mumbua Musya, the first wife of Musya. He stated that prior to settling in Kyawango, he did not know where Musya hailed from but heard that he came from Kiteta with his two wives, Mumbua and Mwikali. He was however unaware of the fact that Musya’s first built a house for Mumbua but admitted that he was not from Mwikali’s House. He agreed that Yumbu moved to Kithyoko with Melli but he insisted that they all returned to Mwala and denied that he was brought back by the 1st Objector’s father. According to the 1st Petitioner, though Yumbu is the name of his father, he is not his real father. He denied saying that his mother was the second wife of Yumbu Musya. He denied any knowledge of returning upon the request by the 1st Objector’s father or that Mulei came later but insisted that Yumbu was not his father despite being known as Yumbu as the clan confirmed that he came from Musya’s family. He was however unaware that he was taken care of by the 1st Objector’s father as his brother’s son. He denied stating that Yumbu never got a share of the land and stated that the clan meeting was convened around Mutuku’s home. In his evidence the clan decided to give the land to Makau and Mulei Yumbu and they were told to move into the bushy land and stay there as he was told it belonged to Musya. It was then that the 1st Objector laid claim to the land and divided it into two parcels. According to him, other people such as Kioko and Mutunga also moved to Kithyoko.",
            "33. According to the 1st Petitioner Syomutune was given land in Athi when there was nobody there but he was unaware that the land was possessed by other people.",
            "34. In re-examination, he explained that Syomutune is the same as Mumbua and that he belonged to that house while the 1st Objector belongs to Mwikali House and they have their own parcels of land. He insisted that the 1st Objector attended the clan meeting of 1973 as confirmed from the clan deliberations in which he is indicated was Mwania Mutuku. The meeting was chaired by Paul Manthi. There was another meeting in 1980 and the agenda was the settlement of the 1st petitioner and his brother and they were settled on the land of Musya’s first wife, Syomutune on plot 336 which is along Athi River. According to him, they went there after it was agreed that it was Syomutune’s share and they have been living there. It was his evidence that he is not interested in the share for Mwikali’s House or Musya’s House which is a big family since there are other survivor of the said Houses.",
            "Determination",
            "35. I have considered the evidence placed before this Court by the respective parties. This is a succession cause and not a land dispute. Accordingly, as the deceased’s property in dispute is identified and a greed as being Mwala/Kyawango/336, the only issues for determination are who are the beneficiaries entitled to inherit from the Deceased’s estate and their respective shares in the said estate. According to the Petitioners the suit property Mwala/Kyawango/336, was registered in the names of Kioko Musya and Kithembe Musya in trust for them while the Objectors contend that the said property was the property of Mutuku and was wrongly registered in the names of the said Kioko Musya and Kithembe Musya.",
            "36. It is agreed by the parties herein that both the Petitioners and the Objectors are cousins and that their fathers were brothers and the sons of Musya Kyai. In the present Succession Cause the person whose estate is in issue is that of Kioko Musya. The suit property is registered in common in the names of Kioko Musya and Kithembe Musya who are both deceased. If any of them had left children the matter probably would not have given rise to a dispute or the dispute would have taken a different angle.",
            "37. The Objector’s case is that Musya Kyai had three wives. The first wife was Mumbua Musya who never had a son. The 2nd wife was Mwikali Musya, the mother of Kioko Musya, Yumbu Musya, Mutuku Musya and Kiteta Musya. The third wife was Kivalwa Musya, the mother of Kithembe Musya. While the Objector denies that he knew Syomutune, the Petitioners’ case is that Syomutune is the same person as Mumbua Musya and that it is this Syomutune who was their mother. According to the evidence presented in Court by the 1st Petitioner, he is the son of Musya Kyai by Syomutune Musya alias Mumbua Musya.",
            "38. However, from the documentary evidence forming part of this record, including some sworn affidavits by the 1st Petitioner himself, it is expressly disclosed that the first Petitioner is the son of Yumbu Musya. It is only when he testified that he denied being the son of Yumbu. One wonders why in nearly all his documents, some on oath he would assert that he was a son of Yumbu when he was in fact the son of Musya Kyai.",
            "39. On my part I have reviewed the evidence on record and I find that the 1st Petitioner’s evidence that he was a son of Musya Kyai cannot be believed in light of the contradictory averments made in the affidavits sworn by him. It would seem that he adopted this line of evidence in order to claim a superior right over the suit property on the basis that he is a son to Musya Kyai and therefore is entitled to inherit the said land as their house was not given any land. From the evidence on record it is clear that the properties of Musya Kyai were divided amongst the Houses and that each House was to divide the same in accordance with the number of the children in that House. One of his properties was the suit land. Both the Petitioner and the Objectors agree that the registration of the suit land in the names of Kioko Musya and Kithembe Musya was not for their own benefit but in trust.",
            "40. Though the 1st Objector contends that the suit property ought to be given to their House, I find no satisfactory evidence that this is the case. Neither the Petitioners nor the Objectors called any evidence to support their respective cases. The Petitioners did not call any witness to support the fact that two meetings were called at which it was resolved that the suit properties be given to them as the said documents were not even signed. On the other hand, the Objectors did not call any other witness to corroborate their claim to the suit land.",
            "41. In the absence of evidence in support of either the petitioners’ case or the objectors’ case, the suit land remains the property of Kioko and Kithembe registered in their names as trustees. Since there is no claimant from either of the said persons and since it is agreed that the suit property was originally the property of Musya Kyai, I find that since there was evidence that Musya Kyai’s children had benefited from the sharing of his ancestral land, the land held in trust by the Deceased’s Persons herein, Kioko Musya and Kithembe Musya being land parcel Mwala/Kyawango/336 ought to be shared equally among all the beneficiaries of Musya Kyai.",
            "42. Accordingly, I direct that.",
            "1. Land Parcel Number Mwala/Kyawango/336 be registered jointly in the names of the 1st Petitioner and the 1st Objector herein, Nelson Makau Yumbu and David Mwania for themselves and in trust for all the beneficiaries of the estate of Musya Kyai.",
            "2. The land parcel Mwala/Kyawango/336 shall be distributed equally between the children of Musya Kyai, who left behind beneficiaries.",
            "3.  Each of the said Houses shall then determine their mode of distribution of their respective shares and in the absence of such agreement shall be distributed equally amongst them.",
            "4. Let the 1st Petitioner and the 1st Objector herein, Nelson Makau Yumbu and David Mwania identify the said the children of Musya Kyai, who left behind beneficiaries and file the same within 45 days for further orders.",
            "5. For the purposes of that exercise the Petitioners herein shall be deemed as being the sons of Yumbu Musya.",
            "43. There will be no order as to costs.",
            "44.  Orders accordingly.",

            "RULING",
            "1. By a further amended notice of motion dated on 26/3/2021, supported by an affidavit of James Taitumu Kubai sworn on  even date, the applicant seeks amendment of the originating summons and joinder of the proposed intended 2nd, 3rd and 4th defendants and inhibition orders.",
            "2. The basis of the application is that there are legitimate claims over the additional parties who are now jointly registered in the suit land with the 1st defendant as per attached certificates of search and that it is in the interest of justice and determination of issues under controversy to bring all the parties on board.",
            "3. In the supporting affidavit the applicant avers the suit land has changed hands after a certificate of confirmation of grant was issued regarding the suit land.",
            "4. The application is opposed by the 1st respondent through a replying affidavit sworn on 8.7.2021 on the grounds that the 2nd – 4th intended defendants are her children who are beneficiaries to the estate of the deceased and are lawfully registered after the confirmation of grant. This was after the applicant was found lacking any legitimate claim over the suit land.",
            "5. Further it is averred the applicant is abusing the court process by filing multiplicity of cases namely Meru ELC No. 45 of 2020.  Additionally, the 1st defendant claims the applicant had sought stay of this matter so as to await the outcome of the succession cause which has now been determined in her favour hence he ought to withdraw this matter.",
            "6. The 1st defendant has filed written submissions dated 21.10.2021 relying on the case of Murithi & 2 Others –vs- Dorcas Muthoni Karani & 5 Others [2019] eKLR on the proposition that allowing the amendment and joinder of more parties will prejudice her yet there is no legitimate/identifiable interest in the matter.",
            "Similarly the 1st defendant urges the court to decline to grant the prayer for inhibition since the applicant has not disclosed any legitimate interest over the suit land.",
            "7. Order 1 rule 3 and 6  grants the court powers upon request to allow joinder of defendants where there is a common question of law or fact and where they are likely to be jointly or severally liable.",
            "8. Order 1 rule 10 allows for substitution or addition of parties to a suit in order to effectually and completely adjudicate upon and settle all questions involved in the suit.",
            "9. Under Order 1 rule 10 (4) once a defendant is added the plaint shall be amended and served upon all the parties in line with Order 8 rule 3, 5 and 7 of the Civil Procedure Rules.",
            "10. In the instant case the 1st respondent has admitted the intended defendants are now jointly owning the suit land together with her since the confirmation of grant was issued.  A copy of the grant attached to the supporting affidavit confirms those developments.",
            "11. Given the admissions, there is no doubt the proposed 2nd – 4th defendants are now absolute co-owners of the suit land.  In line with Section 25 and 26 of the Land Registration Act, the title deed they hold is presumed prima facie prove of ownership.  I therefore find that they are essential parties to this suit who will be affected by its outcome.",
            "12. In line with Article 50 of the Constitution; it would be unfair to have this dispute resolved in their absence yet they are likely to be adversely affected by the outcome.",
            "13. Further the  right to be heard is a Constitutional right and hence it would be against the rules of natural justice to shut them out yet they have a legitimate stake in the suit land as held in Mbaki & Others –vs- Macharia & Another [2005] 2 E.A 206 and in Julius Gatambia & Another –vs- James Macharia Gichure & Another [2018] eKLR.",
            "14. Turning to the issue of inhibition, Section 68 (1) of the Land Registration Act grants a court powers to issue an inhibition inhibiting for a particular time or until the occurrence of a particular event, or generally until a further order or the registration of any dealing with any land, lease or charge.",
            "15. In Dorcas Muthoni & 2 Others –vs- Michael Ireri Ngari [2016] eKLR, it was held an order of inhibition is similar to a prohibitory injunction which bars a registered owner of property under dispute from registering any transaction over the property until further orders or a suit is disposed off.",
            "16. Before issuance of such an order, there must be a party seeking such orders as held in Daniel Gitau Kuria –vs- Muthoni Mbugua Ndumo & 3 Others [2021] eKLR.",
            "17. The applicant’s claim is based on adverse possession.  It is now admitted that the land has through succession process been shared among the beneficiaries to the estate.  Similarly there is evidence the applicant has been removed the occupation and his structures allegedly destroyed.  His interests or claim for adverse possession are yet to be determined.  The court must be guided by the principle that the court should always take the course that carries the lower risk of injustice as held in Films Rover International & Others –vs- Cannon Films Sales Ltd [1986] 3 (ALL.E.R 772).",
            "18. In the circumstances, my finding is that the applicant has not given any ground why he deserves an inhibition order.  The prayer is declined.",
            "19. For avoidance prayer 2 of the further amended notice of motion is allowed.  The amended originating summons to be filed and served within 14 days from the date hereof.  Prayers 3 and 4 are denied.",

            "RULING",
            "[1]  The defendant herein was granted leave to defend the suit vide the ruling dated 14 July 2021 and was consequently directed to serve the Defence within 7 days from the date of the ruling. The matter was thereafter certified ready for hearing on 27 September 2021 and fixed for hearing on 15 November 2021. On the 15 November 2021, Ms. Adhiambo, learned counsel for the defendant, appeared unprepared to proceed, contending that she was never served with the plaintiff’s List and Bundle of Documents. The matter was accordingly stood over to 17 November 2021 for hearing, after Mr. Kongere for the plaintiff demonstrated that service of all the documents filed by the plaintiff, including its witness statement, had been effected via email. Thus, in the interests of justice, time was granted for the plaintiff’s counsel to additionally serve hard copies of their documents on the defence.",
            "[2]  All this while, the defendant had filed no witness statement or documentary exhibit as directed. Consequently, Mr. Kongere was led into believing that the defendant intended to rely solely on its Defence. The matter accordingly proceeded to hearing of the plaintiff’s case on that basis. After the close of the plaintiff’s case, counsel for the defendant, for the first time, indicated that the defendant intended to call one witness and asked for adjournment for that purpose; notwithstanding that no witness statement of the proposed witness or any other witness for that matter, was ever filed or served on the plaintiff. Counsel for the defendant expressed the view that no prejudice would be suffered by the plaintiff as it would avail itself of the opportunity to cross-examine the proposed witness.",
            "[3]   Naturally, Mr. Kongere opposed the application. In his submission, the court has a duty to ensure, not only fair hearing, but also the expeditious disposal of the cases filed before it. He pointed out that it is a requirement of the Civil Procedure Rules that the Defence be filed together with witness statements, as well as bundles of documents that a party wishes to rely on. His posturing was that the defendant has itself to blame for its non-compliance. He added that he even reminded counsel for the defendant of the need to file witness statements and documents; but his reminder remained unheeded as of 15 November 2021 when the suit came up for hearing.",
            "[4]  Thus, it was the contention of Mr. Kongere that, since the plaintiff proceeded with the hearing of its side of the case on the assumption that the defendant was going to rely on the Defence as filed, it would be prejudicial to then allow the defendant to adduce oral evidence in the manner proposed by Ms. Adhiambo. He urged the Court to take judicial notice that this is a suit that has been pending since March 2020. He asked the Court to take judicial notice of the fact that the parent company, known as Multiple Hauliers (EA) Limited is presently the subject of administration proceedings; hence the need to expedite the resolution of this particular dispute. Mr. Kongere concluded his submissions by underscoring the fact that no explanation was proffered by Ms. Adhiambo for non-compliance. He consequently prayed for the dismissal of Ms. Adhiambo’s application and for the defence case to be marked as closed so that directions can be taken on the filing of submissions.",
            "[5]   I have carefully considered the submissions by learned counsel from the backdrop of Order 7 Rule 5 of the Civil Procedure Rules; which provides that:",
            "The defence and counterclaim filed under rule 1 and 2 shall be accompanied by—",
            "a)  an affidavit under Order 4 rule 1(2) where there is a counterclaim;",
            "b) a list of witnesses to be called at the trial;",
            "c)  written statements signed by the witnesses except expert witnesses; and",
            "d) Copies of documents to be relied on at the trial.",
            "Provided that statements under sub-rule (c) may with leave of the court be furnished at least fifteen days prior to the trial conference under Order 11.",
            "[6]   It is not in dispute that the defendant did not comply with this requirement when it filed its defence on 10 February 2021. It failed to comply even after the ruling of 14 July 2021 aforementioned and therefore took no action at all by 15 November 2021 when this suit came up for hearing. This was in spite of a reminder by counsel for the plaintiff. In premises, it is important to pose the question, why pre-trial disclosure? The answer to that question is to be found in Halsbury’s Laws of England Volume 13 where the learned authors of the treatise opine that:",
            "“The function of the discovery of documents is to provide the parties with relevant documentary material before the trial so as to assist them in appraising the strength or weakness of their relevant cases, and thus to provide the basis for the fair disposal of the proceedings before or at the trial. Each party is thereby enabled to sit before the trial or to adduce in evidence at the trial relevant documentary material to support or rebut the case made by or against him, to eliminate surprise at or before the trial relating to the documentary evidence and to reduce the cost of litigation.",
            "[7] Thus pre-trial disclosure is not just a procedural edict; it is anchored in Article 50(2) of the Constitution and is therefore a cardinal requirement that ought not to be taken lightly, as counsel for the defendant appeared to do. The significance of pre-trial disclosure was emphasized by the Supreme Court in Raila Odinga & 5 Others vs. IEBC and 3 Others [2013] eKLR thus:",
            "“The parties have a duty to ensure they comply with their respective time lines, and the court must adhere to its own. There must be a fair and level playing field so that no party or the court loses the time that he/she/it is entitled to, and no extra burden should be imposed on any party or the court as a result of omissions or characteristics which were foreseeable or could have been avoided…if the new material is so substantial involving not only a further affidavit but massive additional evidence, so as to make it difficult or impossible for the other party to respond effectively, the court must act with abundant caution and care in the exercise of its discretion to grant leave for the filing of further affidavits and or admissions of additional evidence.”",
            "[8]   In the instant matter, timelines were set for compliance; particularly compliance by the defendant. The defendant failed to comply. On its part, the plaintiff has presented its evidence to conclusion and closed its case; and although Ms. Adhiambo posited that no prejudice will be occasioned since the plaintiff will have an opportunity to cross-examine the defence witness, the issue here is about fairness, a level playing field and equality of arms. It would go against all these tenets of natural justice to let the plaintiff grope in the dark and presume that the evidence to be presented against it will not be out of the ordinary; particularly in this instance in which no justification at all was given for non-compliance.",
            "[9]  It is therefore my finding that it would be unfair to grant the defendant’s request and allow it to call a witness in its defence without prior compliance with Order 7 Rule 5 of the Civil Procedure Rules. As was aptly stated by Kiage, JA in Nicholas Kiptoo Arap Korir Salat vs. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 6 Others [2013] eKLR that:",
            "“…it is in the even-handed and dispassionate application of rules that Courts give assurance that there is clear method in the manner in which things are done so that outcomes can be anticipated with a measure of confidence, certainty and clarity.”",
            "[10]    In the result, the application by Ms. Adhiambo to be allowed to present oral evidence in support of the defence case without prior compliance with the applicable procedural law as to disclosure is consequently dismissed with attendant costs and the defence case treated as closed.",
            "It is so ordered.",

            "(Being an Appeal from the Ruling of Hon P. Mbulika (RM) delivered at Kisumu in Chief Magistrate’s Court Children Case No 63 of 2012 on 1st November 2018) ",
            "JUDGMENT",
            "INTRODUCTION",
            "1. In her decision of 1st November 2018, the Learned Trial Magistrate, Hon P. Mbulika, Resident Magistrate, reviewed the Trial Court’s Judgment dated 30th November 2012 in the following terms:-",
            "a. Order 6; regarding monthly payment of support. The Defendant shall pay a sum of 7,000 on or before every 5th of the month.",
            "b. All the other orders shall remain as it is(sic)",
            "2. Being aggrieved with the said decision, on 16th November 2018, the Appellant filed a Memorandum of Appeal dated 16th November 2018. He relied on seven (7) grounds of appeal.",
            "3. The Appellant filed his Written Submissions dated 30th April 2021 on 4th May 2021 while the Respondent filed her undated Written Submissions on 22nd July 2021. The Judgment herein is therefore based on the said Written Submissions which both parties relied upon in their entirety.",
            "LEGAL ANALYSIS",
            "4. It is settled law that the duty of a first appellate court is to evaluate afresh the evidence adduced before the trial court in order to arrive at its own independent conclusion but bearing in mind that it neither saw nor heard the witnesses testify.",
            "5. This was aptly stated in the case of Selle & Another vs. Associated Motor Boat Co Ltd & Others [1968] EA 123 where the court therein rendered itself as follows:-",
            "\"...this court is not bound necessarily to accept the findings of fact by the court below. An appeal to this court ... is by way of retrial and the principles upon which this court acts in such an appeal are well settled. Briefly put they are that this court   must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect...\"",
            "6. The principle behind this conclusion is that as an appellate court will not have had the advantage of having seen and heard the evidence of witnesses, it should exercise its jurisdiction to review the evidence with caution and it is not enough that the appellate court might have come to a different conclusion.",
            "7. Having looked at the Memorandum of Appeal, Record of Appeal, Appellant’s and Respondent’s Submissions, it was the considered view of this court that the issue that had been placed before it for determination were as follows:-",
            "a. Whether or not the Learned Trial Magistrate erred in having distributed the various parental responsibilities to the Appellant and the Respondent without considering his net pay warranting the interference of this court.",
            "b. Whether or not the Learned Trial Magistrate erred in having awarded the Respondent herein actual custody of the children.",
            "8. The Appellant admitted that he was the father of the two (2) children he sired with the Respondent herein and argued that he therefore had a right to access and/ or visitation and ought to be given a chance to guide and counsel the children as a parent.",
            "9. He asserted that he had been informed by strangers that his daughter had been sexually harassed by the Respondent’s lover which was confirmed by a doctor at Aga Khan Hospital who informed him that the child suffered a psychological problem.",
            "10. He urged the court to reduce the monthly upkeep of Kshs 7,000/= to Kshs 3,500/= as he was straining to pay for boarding fees for Hope Miriam and still pay Kshs 7,000/= to the Respondent for upkeep. He contended that the Respondent ought to bear the other half as she was in a gainful employment and must take the responsibilities as a parent and as required by law.",
            "11. On her part, the Respondent submitted that she adduced receipts before the Trial Court which indicated how she incurred the expenses contested by the Appellant in Ground of Appeal No 1. She added that her daughter was still undergoing treatment, psychiatric counselling and therapy treatment in which she spent more than Kshs 7,000/= per month.",
            "12. She pointed out that she used her medical scheme to cater for the medical expenses but that at times it exhausted her monthly scheme forcing her to use cash. She added that she also took care of his son’s medical expenses whenever the need arose. She urged this court to direct that together with the Appellant, they share any medical expenses that could not be taken care of by the scheme.",
            "13. She averred that it was her wish that his children would bond with their father as he was allowed to visit them once they close schools and take them out for bonding but that the few times she had tried to assist the children bond with him, he insulted her instead. She added that she even gave their daughter a mobile phone to communicate with the Appellant and sometimes she would cry after his insults. She asserted that he would tell their daughter to stop calling and disturbing him as it would break his marriage. She urged the court not to allow him to disturb the children’s peace of mind.",
            "14. She admitted that he had been paying school fees for the daughter only neglecting their son. She asked the court to direct the Appellant to assist in the shopping expenses also. She was emphatic that the last time the Appellant bought shoes for the children was in 2018 January.",
            "15. She urged this court to raise the sum he paid monthly from Kshs 7,000/= to Kshs 10,000/= due to the rise of cost of living that has been caused by the pandemic. She argued that the Appellant is a deputy head teacher whose salary was high and was able to pay the said sum of Kshs 10,000/=.",
            "16. She was categorical that the children required maintenance as follows:-",
            "i. Food                                       Kshs 10,000 per month",
            "ii. Clothing                                Kshs 2,000/=",
            "iii. Rent                                     Kshs 10,000/= per month",
            "iv. Medical                                Kshs 10,000/= per month",
            "v. Security and bills                  as per the use",
            "vi. Uniform and stationery        Kshs 20,000/= per annum",
            "vii. School fees                          as per structure",
            "viii. Back to school shopping and pocket money     Kshs 5,000/=",
            "17. She urged the court to compel the Appellant to honour his duty as a father.",
            "18. Article 53 (1) (d) of the Constitution provides that every child has the right to parental care and protection, which includes equal responsibility of the mother and father to provide for the child, whether they are married to each other or not.",
            "19. It is also a constitutional imperative that in matters concerning a child, the interests of the child are paramount. To that extent, Article 53 (2) provides that a child’s best interests are of paramount importance in every matter concerning the child. This is emphasised in the Section 4(3) of the Children Act which also recognises the fact that the welfare of the child is paramount.",
            "20. According to Section 24 of the Children Act No 8 of 2001, neither the father nor the mother of a child shall have a superior claim against the other in exercise of such parental responsibility of the duties set out in Section 23(2) of the Children Act. As it was not in dispute that both the Appellant and the Respondent were biological parents of two (2) children, they shared the parental responsibility equally.",
            "21. On 30th November 2012, the Learned Trial Magistrate entered Judgment as follows:-",
            "1. Legal custody of both children is hereby vested up on both parents.",
            "2. Actual custody of the 2 minors is vested up on the Plaintiff/mother with visitation rights to the Defendant/father.",
            "3. Medical expenses of the firstborn child shall be catered for by the insurance and if the treatment fee shall be an excess of cost the Defendant/father shall cater for it.",
            "4. The cost of Kshs 30,000/= that the Plaintiff has already incurred shall be shared. The Defendant to refund the Plaintiff the sum of Kshs 15,000/= on or before the 5/12/2012.",
            "5. The Defendant shall pay school fees of both children. Notice that the first born shall continue to stay at our Lady of Grace (close to hospital) and all school needs/expenses.",
            "6. On or before 8th day of every month the Defendant shall pay a sum of Kshs 10,000/= to cater for food and clothing for the children",
            "7. The Plaintiff shall cater for shelter, clothing, bills and security.",
            "8. No order as to costs.",
            "22. Subsequently, on 1st November 2018, she reviewed Order six (6) of her said Judgment and reduced the monthly payment by the Appellant to Kshs 7,000/=.",
            "23. This court took the view that this was highly irregular for the reason that the Trial Court became functus officio when it delivered its decision on 30th November 2012.",
            "24. Having critically scrutinised the Memorandum of Appeal, the Record of Appeal and rival Submissions, this court found that the Learned Trial Magistrate erred in having directed the Appellant to pay the sum of Kshs 7,000/= as she had no power to review the judgment. The impugned Ruling was irregular as a result of which this court found itself in difficulties in making a determination as to its merit or otherwise.",
            "25. According to Order 45 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010, an order and/or decree of a court can only be reviewed in very limited circumstances. The same provides as follows:-",
            "“(1) Any person considering himself aggrieved –",
            "(a) by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred; or",
            "(b) a decree or order from which no appeal is hereby allowed, and who from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree or order, may apply for a review of judgment to the court which passed the decree or made the order without unreasonable delay.\"",
            "26. This court did not see any of the grounds cited hereinabove existing in the circumstances of the case. In fact, the only remedy that was open to the parties after delivery of the Judgment was to appeal against the Trial Court’s decision.",
            "27. This court therefore found it prudent not to consider the merits or otherwise of the grounds of appeal that had been raised to give the Appellant an opportunity to lodge an appeal against the substantive judgment in the event he still wished to appeal.",
            "The Respondent was also at liberty to file a Cross-Appeal as the issues she raised herein could only be brought by way of a cross-appeal.",
            "DISPOSITION",
            "28. For the foregoing reasons, the upshot of this court’s decision was that the Appellant’s Appeal lodged on 16th November 2018 be and is hereby allowed as technically part of Ground of Appeal No (4) was merited. The effect of this is that the Ruling of the Learned Trial Magistrate that was delivered on 1st November 2018 be and is hereby set aside and/or vacated and that the orders of the Judgment delivered on 30th November 2021 shall remain in force until otherwise vacated and/or set aside on appeal.",
            "29. As the matter herein involved a family, each party will bear its own costs of the Appeal herein.",
            "30. It is so ordered.",

            "1. Tabitha Chepkoech (Accused) was charged with the offence of murder contrary to Section 203 as read with Section 204 of the Penal Code. The particulars of the offence were that on 5th day of May, 2019 at Kapkwen Market, within Bomet Central Sub-County murdered one Kevin Kiptoo Bett.",
            "2. The prosecution called 7 witnesses whose testimony is now on record and is summarized as follows.  PW1 the mother of the deceased was alerted by PW2 who was the deceased’s friend that her son had been stabbed at the Accused’s house and she rushed to pick him and take him to hospital.  She requested PW3, mother to the deceased’s uncle (motorcycle rider) to carry him.  PW4 identified the body to the pathologist (PW6) who conducted the postmortem at Longisa County Referral hospital mortuary.  PW6 formed the opinion that the cause of death was hemorrhage which led to the collapse of the heart secondary to assault.  PW5 was the Government analyst who conducted forensic examination on the deceased’s clothes and murder weapon.  He opined that the DNA generated from the knife matched the DNA generated from the deceased’s clothes.  The Investigating Officer (PW7) wrapped up the testimonies of the witnesses and produced the exhibits.",
            "3. At the close of the prosecution case, the prosecution submitted that the deceased had made a dying declaration and that the testimonies of PW1, PW2 and PW3 were corroborative and that the expert evidence also lend credence to the testimony of PW1, PW2 and PW3.  The Prosecution submitted that it had established a prima facie case to warrant the Accused person being put on her defence.",
            "4. The defence submitted that proof of death and cause thereof were not in dispute.  They however submitted that the evidence did not establish a link between the Accused and the death of the deceased and neither had the prosecution witnesses linked the murder weapon to the Accused.  They submitted that the prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case against the Accused and that she should be acquitted at this stage.",
            "5. I have considered the evidence already on record and the respective submissions of the party.  The only issue in this ruling is whether or not a prima facie case has been established against the Accused.",
            "6. A prima facie case has been defined as “….one on which a reasonable tribunal, properly directing its mind to the law and the evidence could convict if no explanation is offered by the defence.”  [See Ramanlal Trambaklal Bhatt V. R (1957) E.A. 332 at P. 334-335].",
            "7. At this stage of the trial, I am not required to undertake a detailed analysis of the evidence [See Republic Vs. Samuel Karanja Kiria (2009) eKLR].  I have however considered all the evidence on record and the submissions of Counsel.  It is my finding that the prosecution has established a prima facie case against the Accused.  She has a case to answer and is called upon to elect her mode of defence in accordance with Section 306 of the Criminal Procedure Code.",

            "(Being an Appeal from the Ruling of Hon E. Rashid (RM) ",
            "delivered at Winam in Principal Magistrate’s Court ",
            "Case No E033 of 2021 on 16th April 2021)",
            "RULING",
            "1. On 18th May 2021, the Appellant herein filed a Notice of Motion application and Memorandum of Appeal both dated 17th May 2021. In response to the said application, on 4th June 2021, Jackson Kimathi swore a Replying Affidavit on behalf of the Respondents herein. The same was filed on even date.  On 13th July 2021, the Appellant filed a Further Affidavit that she swore on 5th July 2021.",
            "2. On 27th May 2021, the 1st and 2nd Respondents filed a Preliminary Objection dated 24th May 2021. The grounds in the said Preliminary Objection were that the said Memorandum of Appeal was incompetent, having been filed out of time and without leave of court, contrary to the provisions of Section 79G of the Civil Procedure Act which prescribes thirty (30) days for filing appeals from the subordinate court to the High court. The other ground of the Preliminary Objection was that said Notice of Motion application was misconceived and misplaced since there was no competent appeal before this court.",
            "3.  On 22nd June 2021, this court directed that the aforesaid Preliminary Objection would be heard in priority to the aforesaid Notice of Motion application.",
            "4. The 1st and 2nd Respondents’ Written Submissions were dated 24th May 2021 and filed on 27th May 2021 while those of the Appellant were dated 5th July 2021 and filed on 13th July 2021.",
            "5. This Ruling is based on the said parties’ Written Submissions which they relied upon in their entirety.",
            "LEGAL ANALYSIS",
            "6. The 1st and 2nd Respondents argued that the jurisdiction of this court to hear and determine the Appellant’s application dated 17th May 2021 emanates from there being a competent Memorandum of Appeal on the court’s record. They were emphatic that that was not the case in this matter.",
            "7. They argued that the Ruling appealed from by the Appellant was delivered on 16th April 2021 and the Appellant filed her Memorandum of Appeal on 18th May 2021 which was out of the statutory limit of thirty days within which to file an appeal.",
            "8. They invoked Section 79 G of the Civil Procedure Act and asserted that the Appellant’s appeal was filed without leave of court and therefore ought to be struck out for being incompetent.",
            "9. They were categorical that for the foregoing reasons there was no competent appeal before this court to warrant the hearing of the application dated 17th May 2021.",
            "10. In response to the Respondents’ assertions the Appellant argued that exclusive of the gazetted Public Holiday (Eid ul Fitr) which was 14th May 2021, the deadline for filing her Memorandum of Appeal was 18th May 2021. It was her contention that her Memorandum of Appeal was therefore filed within time.",
            "11. The time for filing appeals from Subordinate Courts in respect to civil suits is prescribed in Section 79(G) of the Civil Procedure Act.  This is what that Section provides:",
            "“Every appeal from a subordinate court to the High Court shall be filed within a period of thirty days from the date of the decree or order appealed against, excluding from such period any time which the lower court may certify as having been requisite for the preparation and delivery to the appellant of a copy of the decree or order.",
            "Provided that an appeal may be admitted out of time if the appellant satisfies the Court that he had good and sufficient cause for not filing the appeal in time.”",
            "12.  The Civil Procedure Act is silent on how the time in Section 79(G) ought to be computed.  The court therefore resorts to Section 57 of the provisions of The Interpretation and General Provisions Act Cap 2 (Laws of Kenya) that provides that:-",
            "“In computing time for the purposes of a written law, unless the contrary intention appears- ",
            "a. A period of days from the happening of an event or the doing of an act or thing shall be deemed to be exclusive of the day on which the event happens or the act or thing is done;",
            "b. If the last day of the period is Sunday or a public holiday or also official non-working days which days are in this section referred to as excluded days), the period shall include the next following day, not being an excluded day;",
            "c. Where an act or proceeding is directed or allowed to be done or taken on a certain day, then, if that day happens to be an excluded day, the act or proceeding shall be considered as done or taken in due time if it is done or taken on the next day afterwards, not being an excluded day;",
            "d. Where an act or proceeding is directed or allowed to be done or taken within any time not exceeding six days, excluded days shall not be reckoned in the computation of the time.”",
            "13. In view of Section 57 (a) of the Interpretation and General Provisions Act, 16th April 2021 was excluded from the computation being the day when the Ruling sought to be appealed from was delivered. However, as the following day was not an excluded day as envisaged in Section 57 (b) and (d) of the Interpretation and General Provisions Act, time started running from 17th April 2021 which was a Saturday.",
            "14.  The Appellant therefore ought to have her Memorandum of Appeal between the 17th April 2021 and on or before the 17th May 2021. However, it was evident that public holidays were excluded in computing the period within which the Appellant ought to have filed her Memorandum of Appeal.",
            "15. It was not disputed that 14th May 2021 was a public holiday (Eid ul Fitr). The 1st May 2021 was Labour Day and also a public holiday in Kenya. In line with Section 57 (c) of the Interpretation and General Provisions Act, the Appellant had until 19th May 2021 to file her Memorandum of Appeal. It was therefore this court’s view that the Appellant’s Memorandum of Appeal was duly filed within the statutory prescribed period. In view of this finding, the second limb of the Respondent’s Preliminary Objection was therefore rendered moot.",
            "DISPOSITION",
            "16. For the foregoing reasons, the upshot of this court’s decision was that the 1st and 2nd Respondents’ Preliminary Objection dated 24th May 2021 and filed on 27th May 2021 was not merited and the same be and is hereby dismissed with costs to the Appellant.",
            "17. It is so ordered.",

            "JUDGMENT",
            "1) Hon. Isaac Mwaura Maigua, the appellant herein being a member of the 1st respondent was nominated as a member of the Senate representing persons with disability in the 12th Parliament.  On 1st February 2021, the 1st respondent commenced disciplinary proceedings against the appellant on various grounds namely that he had violated the party constitution and for contravening the code of conduct.",
            "2) The 1st respondent’s National Disciplinary Committee (NDC) after hearing the parties resolved to have the appellant suspended for 6 months from the 1st respondent’s membership.  The respondent’s National Management Committee (NMC) acting on behalf of the National Executive Committee (NEC) reviewed the NDC decision and substituted it with that of expulsion.",
            "3) Being aggrieved by the decision of NMC, the appellant filed a complaint with the Political Parties Tribunal (PPDT) hereinafter referred to as the ‘Tribunal’.  The Tribunal heard the complaint and proceeded to dismiss the appellant’s complaint vide its decision delivered on 7th May 2021. ",
            "4) Being aggrieved by the tribunal’s dismissal order, the appellant preferred this appeal and put forward the following grounds",
            "i. The honorable tribunal erred in law and in fact having found that the complainant was granted a fair hearing.",
            "ii. The honourable tribunal misdirected itself in failing to confirm that the appellant was not accorded a fair hearing contrary to the relevant law and specifically Regulation 52 the Jubilee Party National Disciplinary Committee Regulations, 2017.",
            "iii. The honorable tribunal erred in law and in fact in finding that there was no sufficient basis to fault the 1st respondent’s disciplinary committee and failed to consider that the 1st respondent failed to tender evidence to prove whether the same had been served upon the appellant as required under Regulation 52 the Jubilee Party National Disciplinary Committee Regulations, 2017.",
            "iv. The honorable tribunal erred in law and in fact in not finding that the appellant was discriminated against in the entire disciplinary process.",
            "v. The honorable tribunal erred in law and in fact in failing to find and hold that the charges as against the appellant were not justified.",
            "vi. The honourable court misdirected itself in failing to find and hold that there exist as a coalition agreement between PDR and now UDA with Jubilee party and therefore the appellant did to advance the policies of another political party.",
            "vii. The honorable tribunal erred in law and in fact in failing to find and hold that the charges as against the appellant were unjustified as they failed to indicate in any manner how the appellant acted in a manner that was disloyal to the 1st respondent party.",
            "viii. The honorable tribunal erred in law and in fact in failing to find and hold that the 1st respondent party organs have never been constituted or convened since 2017.",
            "ix. The honorable tribunal erred in law and in fact in awarding costs as against the appellant",
            "x. The honoruabe Tribunal misdirected itself in arriving at its decision or orders by taking into account extraneous matters and misinterpreting issues such as:",
            "a) There was no evidence on the vagueness of the charges before the 1st respondent’s disciplinary committee.",
            "b) That the appellant did not seek for more time to appropriately prepare his defence before the 1st respondent’s disciplinary committee.",
            "c) That the defence of the appellant was not sufficient.",
            "xi. The honorable tribunal erred in law in failing to grant the appellant the orders sought and dismissed the complaint.",
            "5) When this appeal came up for hearing, this court gave directions to have the same disposed of by written submissions.",
            "6) I have re-evaluated the case that was before the Tribunal.  I have  also considered the rival written submissions and the authorities cited by the parties.",
            "7) In the first and second and third grounds of appeal, the appellant is of the submission that the political parties tribunal erred when it found that the appellant had been granted a fair hearing by the 1st respondent yet the contrary happened.  It is the argument of the appellant that he was denied a fair hearing by the 1st respondent’s disciplinary committee under Article 13.1.11 of the Jubilee Party Constitution and Regulations 5, 9,13,14, 20 and 52 of the Jubilee Party National Disciplinary Committee Regulations, 2017.",
            "8) The appellant further argued that the 1st respondent’s disciplinary committee purported to hear and determine the allegations levelled against him without availing responses to the preliminary objections he raised and that the 1st respondent produced evidence of the offences he was charged with during the disciplinary hearing contrary to the regulations that require that all evidence submitted by the complainant be made available during the service of the charge sheet.",
            "9) It is for this reason that the appellant avers that he was not accorded a fair hearing but was instead ambushed on the date of hearing.  The appellant also pointed out that statement that the appellant (complainant) was guilty of the offences listed cannot and did not constitute reasons for the decision.",
            "10) It is argued that the decision violated Articles 47 and 50 of the constitution of Kenya, 2010 Sections 4(2) and 4(3) of the Fair Administrative Action Act, 2015, and Regulations 5 and 52 of the Jubilee Party National Disciplinary Committee Regulations, 2017.",
            "11) The appellant further accused the 1st respondent of proceeding to implement the impugned decision prematurely.  The appellant also stated that the Disciplinary decision was only attached as the alleged reasoned decision in the 1st respondent’s pleadings.  The appellant further argued that any implementation of a decision tainted by such irregularities was unjust and hence has no effect in law.",
            "12) In the fourth ground of appeal, the appellant argued that he was discriminated in the entire disciplinary process.  The appellant pointed out that the 1st respondent contravened Article 27 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 by selectively and discriminately subjecting him to a disciplinary process without any explanation or reasons at all, therefore the actions confirm the illegalities malice and utter discrimination.",
            "13) The appellant denied committing the acts specified in Section 14(5) of the Political Parties Act that would be used to deem a member as having resigned from a political party.  He further denied having participated in the formation of any other political party or in the promotion of the interests of another political party.",
            "14) It is argued that the Political Parties Tribunal erred in not finding that the appellant was discriminated against in the entire disciplinary process and in failing to find and hold that the charges preferred against him were unjustified on the basis that it remained silent in taking cognizant existence of a coalition agreement between the Party of Development Reforms (PDR) now referred as United Democratic Alliance (UDA) with Jubilee party.",
            "15) It is the submission of the appellant that the penalty meted on him was unfair unreasonable, malicious and unwarranted in the circumstances of this case.  The appellant submits that the 1st respondent abused the discretion in the punishment meted out taking into account the previous circumstances where no disciplinary proceedings were ever meted on any of the party members who supported contestants of other parties and further  failed to take into consideration that there exists a coalition agreement between PDR (Now UDA) with Jubilee Party which the Disciplinary Committee ought to have taken judicial notice pursuant to Gazette Notice no. 11254 issue no. 37 of 28th December 2020.  The appellant accused the Tribunal of awarding costs to the 1st respondent without considering the above circumstances.",
            "16) The appellant further argued that the Political Parties Tribunal misdirected itself in arriving at its decision by taking into account extraneous matters.  First, that there was no evidence on the vagueness of the charges before the 1st respondent’s Disciplinary Committee.  Secondly, that the appellant did not seek for more time to appropriately prepare his defence before the 1st respondent’s disciplinary committee.  Thirdly, that the defence of the appellant was not sufficient.",
            "17) It is also the submission of the appellant that the Tribunal erred when it proceeded to find that there was no sufficient basis to fault the 1st respondent’s National Disciplinary Committee (NDC) exercise of its discretion yet the NDC decision was never served upon the appellant.",
            "18) It is argued that the Jubilee Party’s Disciplinary Committee’s decision was varied from a suspension of six (6) months to an expulsion by the party National Management Committee (NMC).  The appellant is of the submission that the sanction meted out was unreasonable in the circumstances.",
            "19) The appellant pointed out that the Tribunal was silent on the issue of service and instead noted that the 1st respondent had attached a reasoned decision to its replying affidavit.  It is said the Tribunal failed to resolve the issue of service as required under Regulation 52 of the Jubilee party National Disciplinary Committee Regulations, 2017.",
            "20) It is stated that the Tribunal treated the decision attached to 1st respondent’s relying affidavit just as an annexure and that there was no evidence tendered proving that service of the decision was ever effected upon the appellant hence it is the appellant’s submission that the Tribunal unfairly dismissed his complaint without any lawful basis.",
            "21) The appellant further argued that he was and is entitled under Articles 98, 99 and 105 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 as read with Section 14 of the Political Parties Act together with Regulation to exhaust all the available forums and appellate process before the position he holds as a nominated senator could be declared vacant by the 3rd respondent and replaced by the 4th respondent via a hurriedly published gazette notice.",
            "22) The appellant also submitted that the 3rd and 4th respondent’s decision with the Tribunal’s judgment on whose strength the two gazette notices were issued by operation of law should be quashed and declared as of no effect and the appellant be awarded all the benefits and privileges the court had in its orders preserved on the 7th May 2021.",
            "23) It is further argued that the decision by the 2nd respondent made on 29th March 2021 to deregister the appellant from the 1st respondent’s party and any gazette notices issued by the 3rd and 4th respondents cannot stand.  It is also stated that the 1st respondent’s decision to expel the appellant was and is still a nullity for want of legal and statutory compliance.",
            "24) In response, the respondents each opposed the appeal urging this court to dismiss the same.  It is the submission of the 1st respondent that the Political Parties Tribunal (PPDT) properly exercised its discretion judicially and judiciously in reaching at its impugned decision.  The 1st respondent further submitted that the decision of PPDT is expressly anchored on law in application to the specific issues and evidence that were placed before it by the parties.",
            "25) The 1st respondent also argued that the PPDT conducted a fair hearing before dismissing the appellant’s complaint.  It was pointed out that service of the charges and its particulars were effected upon the appellant on 1st February 2021 which fact is admitted. The 1st respondent is of the submission that the charges preferred against the appellant were clear, justified and in accordance to Article 13.3:1 D, E and J of the 1st respondent’s constitution.  It is said that the appellant was given sufficient time and platform to prepare and present his defence where the appellant personally and physically participated.",
            "26) The 1st respondent further stated that the decision of PPDT is sound both in fact and in law.  The 1st respondent also argued that its NMC had the discretion under Articles 7(2A) and 13.1.12 of its constitution to legally vary the NDC’s order of suspension against the appellant to that of expulsion.",
            "27) The 1st respondent further pointed out that Regulation 52 of the National Disciplinary Committee Regulations requires that the charged members shall be informed of the ruling and sanctions of the committee together with the reasons thereof and that there is no prescribed time frame nor form of information.  According to the 1st respondent, the information was provided to the appellant.",
            "28) It is also the 1st respondent’s submission that the Political Parties Tribunal gave reasons in its findings with respect to discrimination and that the appellant did not present or substantiate other similar cases that may show bias or discrimination.  Accordingly, it is the 1st respondent’s submission that the appellant failed to discharge his initial burden of proof therefore the Tribunal’s decision cannot be faulted.",
            "29) The 1st respondent further faulted the appellant for accusing the Tribunal of considering extraneous matters yet it is the appellant had raised the issues thus inviting the Tribunal to determine issues in question.  It is also argued that the Tribunal was right in awarding costs since costs follow the event.",
            "30) It is further the submission of the 1st respondent that the appellant’s attempt to introduce new issues in relation to his replacement as a nominated member to the senate cannot legally and factually stand.  It is pointed out by the respondent that this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain, hear and determine matters not placed before the Tribunal.  It is the argument of the 1st respondent that the nomination of the appellant’s replacement crystallised upon his gazettement and that can only be challenged by an election petition and not through this appeal.",
            "31) The 3rd respondent also opposed the appeal through the written submissions filed and dated 16th September 2021.  It is the submission of the 3rd respondent that he performed his constitutional duty under Article 101 (2) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 to declare a vacancy whenever a vacancy occurs in the office of a member of Senate held under Article 98 (1) (b), (c) and (d) of the Constitution.",
            "32) The 3rd respondent further argued that the orders sought in this appeal violate the principle of separation of powers since this court is being invited to interfere with the internal management of parliament and political parties that constitute members of parliament.  This court was urged to refrain from determining political questions but instead leave them to be determined by political parties.  The 3rd respondent further implored upon this court to decline entertaining proceedings instituted against the speaker for actions done in the course of performing mandatory constitutional and statutory duties.",
            "33) It is pointed out that the appellant has failed to demonstrate any actual or threatened violations of the constitution.  The 3rd respondent also stated that this appeal has been overtaken by events as the appellant’s removal as a member of parliament under Article 98(a) (d) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 has already been effected and as such this court will be engaging in an academic exercise by entertaining the present appeal.",
            "34) On its part, the 4th respondent filed written submission opposing the appeal. The 4th respondent just like the 3rd respondent admit that upon the dismissal of the appellant’s complaint by the Political Parties Tribunal, they took the requisite steps to publish in the Kenya Gazette a declaration of a vacancy in respect of the senate position held by the appellant and an election by way of nomination of Sammy Prisa Leshore as duly nominated by the 1st respondent to the Senate to represent persons with disability.",
            "35) The 4th respondent argued that the dispute can only be resolved by the election court hence this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the appeal whose outcome is intended to nullify the election by way of nomination of Sammy Prisa Lesore.",
            "36) The 4th respondent stated that it was joined to this appeal without leave of court therefore he is improperly before this court, thus the appeal as against the 4th respondent is incompetent and fatally defective.",
            "37) It is the submission of the 4th respondent that the appellant was granted a fair hearing before the Political Parties Tribunal.  The 4th respondent further argued that though the charge document was not produced, the pleadings and evidence presented before the Tribunal show that he appellant understood the charges facing him.  It is further pointed out that though the Tribunal was not provided with the charge document, the tribunal noted that the appellant’s replying affidavit contained the details of the charge.",
            "38) The 4th respondent further argued that it cannot lie in the appellant’s mouth to say that he was not given reasonable time to prepare for his defence because it is on record that the Tribunal gave him time to prepare is defence but he declined the offer.",
            "39) It is the argument of the 4th respondent that the failure to provide the appellant with the decision by the 1st respondent did not violate the appellant’s right to a fair trial.  It is said that the decision of the 1st respondent’s NMC dated 8th February 2021 was made public as required under the regulations and therefore the appellant got the opportunity to interrogate and challenge the reasoning by the NDC.",
            "40) On the question of discrimination, it is the argument of the 4th respondent that the appellant did not tender credible evidence that he was discriminated by the 1st respondent.  It is also pointed out that the appellant failed to produce the coalition agreement between the two parties in order for the Tribunal to consider the terms therein and that there is no evidence that PDR is the same as UDA on account of change of names.",
            "41) The 4th respondent further argued that the extract of the coalition agreement produced by the 1st respondent does not grant members of the 1st respondent the right to pledge allegiance to the other coalition party or to be disloyal to one’s party or breach a party’s code of conduct.",
            "42) Having re-evaluated the complaint which was before the Political Parties Tribunal and having considered the rival written submissions plus the authorities cited, this appeal can be determined on broad grounds.  The first issue which was substantively argued before this court is the question whether the appellant was granted a fair hearing by the 1st respondent’s national disciplinary committee.",
            "43) I have considered the rival submissions over this ground.  The appellant appeared before the Tribunal and argued that the 1st respondent denied him a fair hearing by deliberately neglecting to provide him with the evidence upon which its assertions were hinged on prior to the hearing.",
            "44) The appellant further argued before the Tribunal that he was ambushed with a raft of allegations against him while denying him a reasonably sufficient time to prepare for his defence.  The record shows that the Tribunal considered the appellant’s complaint and found no merit.  In its judgment the Tribunal at page 9, the Tribunal stated inter alia as follows:",
            "“The only recorded objection by the complainant relates to the allegation that the complainant was served with evidence at the beginning of the session.",
            "As per the subject NDC minutes, whereas the complainant was granted an opportunity to have the proceedings adjourned due to late service of evidence, the record reflects that his defence team refused to adjourn.”",
            "45) At page 10 of its judgment the Tribunal further stated as follows:",
            "“With respect to the allegation of sufficiency of notice and service of evidence, we note that the NDC regulations are express that the summons should be served within 48 hours prior to the hearing.  From the record, it is evident that the 1st respondent dealt within the timelines that guide the party’s disciplinary process as prescribed in the party laws.  If the complainant felt that the notice period was insufficient, the question we ask ourselves is whether he sought for an adjournment and or more time to the commencement of the NDC hearing. From our perusal on the record, there is no evidence that the complainant sought and was declined an adjournment of the proceedings to allow him what he considered sufficient time to prepare.  In fact from the NDC minutes already referred above, the complainant was granted an opportunity to adjourn the proceedings but his defence team insisted on proceeding with the hearing.”",
            "46) It is clear from the above excerpts that though the Tribunal did expressly state that the appellant was given a fair hearing, it can be inferred that it came to such a conclusion.  There is no dispute that the appellant was served with the evidence at the beginning of the 1st respondent’s disciplinary proceedings.",
            "47) The thinking of the Tribunal that since the appellant did not seek for an adjournment to enable him prepare for his defence meant he was given a fair hearing, in my view is wrong. It is in the opinion of this court that the conduct of providing evidence to the appellant at the time of hearing the complaint is an outright ambush and put the appellant in a disadvantaged position in that he was at a loss as to how to answer the charges and the accusations levelled against him.",
            "48) It is a cardinal rule of natural justice that the right of a fair hearing can only be exercised, upon a party being granted more time to prepare his evidence to respond and controvert evidence that was produced during the disciplinary hearing",
            "49) This court is satisfied that the appellant was not accorded a fair hearing notwithstanding the fact that the appellant did not apply for adjournment of the hearing of the disciplinary proceedings.  The Tribunal therefore erred when it held that the appellant was granted a fair hearing.",
            "50) It is apparent that on the face of it that the 1st respondent breached its Constitutional and its Disciplinary Regulations.  It also goes without saying that the 1st respondent breached Articles 47 and 50 of the Constitution and Section 4 of the Fair Administrative Action Act, 2015.",
            "51) The second main ground argued on appeal by the appellant is that the appellant was discriminated in the entire disciplinary process.  The tribunal in its decision came to the conclusion that the 1st respondent did not discriminate against the complainant in the disciplinary process.  The tribunal stated in page 10 of its judgment in part as follows:",
            "“Indeed, his attempt to show that other party members had been treated differently was countered at the cross-examination of the party secretary General (S.G) when the said SG stated that all cases the party always gave some leeway and opportunity to errant members to conform before taking disciplinary action against them .........Further the complainant did not present or substantiate other similar cases that may point to bias or discrimination.  We are therefore of the considered opinion that the complainant was granted a fair hearing.”",
            "52) The proceedings before the tribunal clearly show that the secretary general of Jubilee party testified before the tribunal.  In cross-examination at pages 22-23 the 1st respondent’s SG stated in part as follows:",
            "“I took issue of the involvement of the complainant to UDA.",
            "UDA previously known as PDR",
            "PDR has a coalition agreement with Jubilee party .....Jubilee was in coalition agreement with people  Democratic party but changed to UDA.  The coalition agreement is not complete.  There was a big election in Kibra, I am aware Jubilee Party members campaigned for ODM and the party had a candidate.  Matter was raised to Sakaja but we did not have a scenario similar to this where party member went against ODM cannot have coalition.",
            "I do not know of disciplinary proceedings against Sakaja and Maina kamanda....”",
            "53) The question is whether the tribunal erred in finding that the appellant was not discriminated against in the entire disciplinary process.  I have already taken into account the rival submissions over this issue. It is apparent from the proceedings conducted before the tribunal that the 1st respondent’s Secretary General admitted that the 1st respondent had a coalition agreement with PDR which later changed to UDA.",
            "54) It is also evident that the appellant was accused of inter alia that he advanced the policies of another political party namely UDA.  The proceedings further indicate that some members of the 1st respondent namely Sakaja and Maina Kamanda supported the ODM candidate in the Kibra by-election yet they were not summoned to undergo any disciplinary process like the appellant.",
            "55) With respect, I am persuaded by the appellant’s argument that the 1st respondent selectively conducted disciplinary proceedings against him for associating himself with another political party just like the other named parties.  The tribunal therefore fell into error when it held that the appellant was not discriminated in the entire disciplinary process.  The appellant did not need to tender further evidence to establish discrimination since the evidence of the 1st respondent’s S.G was sufficient to establish the allegation of discrimination.",
            "56) The third main ground is whether the charges preferred against the appellant were justified.  I have considered the competing submissions over this ground. It is the argument of the appellant that the complaints lodged against him before the disciplinary committee were unjustified because there was in existence a coalition agreement between the Party of Development and Reforms (PDR) now United Democratic Alliance (UDA) with Jubilee.",
            "57) With respect, I am persuaded by the appellant’s arguments. ",
            "The proceedings before the tribunal clearly show that the 1st  respondent’s S.G admitted that there existed a coalition agreement between Jubilee Party  and UDA.  It is therefore clear that the appellant did not advance the policies of another political party as concluded by the disciplinary committee. ",
            "58) A careful perusal of the tribunal proceedings will show that the 1st respondent had failed to establish the manner in which the appellant was disloyal to the party. The tribunal therefore fell into error when it held that the 1st respondent was justified in disciplining the appellant.",
            "59) It is clear in my mind that the 1st respondent’s disciplinary proceedings which led to the expulsion of the appellant from Jubilee Party was not conducted in accordance with the law. ",
            "60) This court also has come to the conclusion that the Jubilee  party’s National Disciplinary Committee processes and the decision that followed was unlawful. ",
            "61) This court further finds that the decision of NDC which was varied by the NMC from the suspension for six months to an expulsion from the 1st respondent party which was then transmitted the national organ including the subsequent decision of 8th February 2021 and the decision by the 2nd respondent dated 29th March, 2021 to deregister the appellant from the 1st respondent party and any gazette notices issued by the 3rd and 4th respondents cannot stand.",
            "62) In the end, this appeal is found to be meritorious. It is allowed. ",
            "Consequently, the decision of the Political Parties Tribunal is set aside and is substituted with an order allowing the complainant’s (now appellant) complaint. ",
            "63) The deregistration of the appellant by the 2nd respondent made on 29th March 2021 and the gazette notice no. 4597 vol. CXXII-102 dated 10th May 2021 and the gazette notice no. 4598 vol. CXXII-103 dated 11th May 2021 issued by the 3rd and 4th respondents respectively are hereby quashed and set aside hence are of no effect and cannot confer any rights.  Costs of the appeal are given to the appellant.",

            "1.  The present ruling is in regard to a Notice of motion dated 31st July 2020 and filed herein on 3rd August 2020 pursuant to, inter alia, sections 1A, 1B,3, 3A and 18 of the Civil Procedure Act Chapter 21 Laws of Kenya and Articles 48 and 50 (1) of the Constitution of Kenya,  2010 (The application herein). One, Joseph Odongo Opiyo (The applicant) through M/S Oguttu Mboya, Ochwal and Partners Advocates formerly, M/S Oguttu, Ochwangi, Ochwal and Company Advocates is seeking the orders infra;",
            "a)  The Honourable court be pleased to order and/or direct the withdrawal and transfer of Ndhiwa SRMCC ELC NO. 14 of 2020, touching on and or concerning the same subject dispute in respect of LR No.Homa Bay/Kawere Konyango Karanding/3413 (hereinafter referred to as the suit property), to this honourable court for hearing and final disposal.",
            "b)  Consequent to prayer 1 herein being granted, the Honourable court be pleased to consolidate the subject matter and the withdrawn Ndhiwa SRMC ELCase NO. 14 of 2020 and upon such conditions, same be heard and disposed of simultaneously.",
            "c)  The Honourable court be pleased to grant such further and/or further orders and or directions, as the Honourable court may deem fit, just and expedient, towards the expeditious disposal of the two suits, which touch and or concern the same suit property.",
            "d)  Costs of the application herein do abide the cause.",
            "2.  The application is based on a nineteen (19) paragraphed supporting affidavit sworn on even date by the applicant and grounds (a) to (z) stated on it’s face. In a nutshell, the applicant states in part that on    17th June 2020, the respondent, Benjamin Okwaro Estika lodged civil proceedings vide Ndhiwa SRM’s Court Environment and land case No. 14 of 2020 by way of a plaint of even date seeking, inter alia, eviction of the applicant from the suit property, LR No. Homa Bay/Kawere/ Konyango Karanding/3413.That on the other hand, the applicant mounted the instant suit against the respondent by way of an originating summons dated 9th July 2020 and filed herein on 17th July 2020 claiming ownership of the suit property by adverse possession. That the issues involved in the two suits are substantially the same. That the issues pertaining to adverse possession can only be entertained by this court which has unlimited jurisdiction over matters concerning land and environment including the issues at the foot of the proceedings pending before Ndhiwa Law courts. That the intended transfer and consolidation of the two suits shall avert wastage of precious judicial time, unnecessary expenses, inconvenience and that the orders sought in this application be granted in the interest of justice.",
            "3.  By a seventeen (17) paragraphed replying affidavit sworn on 1st September 2020 and filed herein on 2nd September 2020, the respondent through the firm of Nyauke and Company Advocates, opposed the application and sought that the application and the Originating summons dated 9th July 2020 altogether, be disallowed. He termed the originating summons an afterthought and an attempt to derail the suit filed at Ndhiwa Law Courts. He annexed a copy of the proceedings in the  case pending at Ndiwa Law Courts and marked as “BOE-01” in support of the affidavit.",
            "4.  On 19th January 2021, this court ordered and directed that the application be argued by written submissions pursuant to Order 51 Rule 16 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010; see also Practice Direction number 33 of the Environment and Land Court Practice Directions, 2014.",
            "5.  So, learned counsel for the applicant duly filed eight (8) paged submissions dated 1st February 2021 on 3rd February 2021. Counsel framed four (4) issues for determination including whether the subordinate court (Ndhiwa Law courts) has the jurisdiction to address the issue of adverse possession and whether the conditions exist to warrant consolidation of the two (2) suits. In the analysis of the issues, counsel urged this court to allow the application and relied on section 38 of the Limitation of Actions Act Chapter 22 Laws of Kenya, section 7 of the sixth Schedule of the Constitution of Kenya 2010, Article 159 (2) (b) of the same Constitution, the case of Chevron (K) Limited -vs-Harrison Charo wa Shutu (2016) eKLR and sections 1A, 1B and 18 of the Civil Procedure Act Chapter 21 Laws of Kenya. ",
            "6.  On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent filed six (6) paged submissions dated 19th January 2021 on 25th January 2021 providing a brief statement of facts of the application and the response thereto. Counsel identified twin issues for determination namely whether the application has merit and whether the ingredients of adverse possession claim has been met. Counsel urged this court to dismiss the application and relied on sections 7 and 38 of the Limitation of Actions Act (supra) and the case of M’Mbaoni M’Ithara-vs-James Mbaka (2019) eKLR. ",
            "7.  On 4th Mach 2021, I called for the original record and typed certified copies of the proceedings and orders, if any, in Ndhiwa Principal Magistrate’s Court Environment and Land case number 14 of 2020 for examination before arriving at this finding. Notably, the same have been availed herein accordingly. ",
            "8.  I have taken into account the application, the replying affidavit and the original record alongside the proceedings as pointed out at paragraph 7 herein above and the rival submissions in their entirety. On that score, has the applicant made a sufficient case for grant of the orders sought in the application?",
            "9.  It is common ground regarding the issues hereunder;",
            "a)  The applicant and the respondent filed their respective suits as discerned at paragraph 2 hereinabove. The former filed his suit earlier than the latter.",
            "b)  The suit property is the same in both suits",
            "c)  The suit property is located within Ndhiwa sub county in Homa Bay County",
            "d)  Both parties reside within the said sub county.",
            "e)  Both suits are yet to be heard and determined",
            "10.    The area of the suit property is measuring zero decimal eight hectare (0.08Ha) as discerned in the parties’ respective pleadings in both suits. Iam guided by section 13 of the Civil Procedure Act Chapter 21 Laws of Kenya thereof.",
            "11.   In view of section 26 (3) and (4) of the Environment and Land Court (ELC) Act, 2015 (2011) as read with sections 7 and 9 (a) of the Magistrates’ Courts Act No. 26 of 2015, Ndhiwa Principal Magistrate’s Court is seized of jurisdiction regarding both suits. I am also aware of section 13 (1) as read with section 26 (4) of the ELC Act on the original and appellate jurisdiction of this court.",
            "12.   The respondent asserted that jurisdiction over the instant suit is the preserve of this court. However, I am of the view that it is not the position in light of the current Constitutional dispensation and as I endorse the decision in the case of Patrick Ndegwa Munyua-vs-Benjamin Kiiru Mwangi and another (2020) eKLR.",
            "13.    Bearing in mind the manner of bringing the instant suit as well the character of the same, I subscribe to the case of Kibutiri-vs-Kibutiri (1983) eKLR where the Court of Appeal held thus;",
            "“The procedure by way of originating summons is intended to enable simple matters to be settled by the court without the expense of bringing an action in the usual way. The procedure is however, not meant to determine matters which involve serious and complex questions of law and fact (Re Giles (2) (1890) 43 Ch D 391 and Kulsumbhai-vs-Abdulhussein (1957) EA 699)….”",
            "14.  Access to justice for all persons is anchored under Articles 6 (3) and 48 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010. The parties can more reasonably and appropriately access justice in both suits before a designated magistrate at Ndhiwa Law Courts rather than before this court.",
            "15.   Thus, it would enhance speedy delivery of justice as commanded by Article 159 (2) (b) of the said Constitution of Kenya,2010  which states that;",
            "“Justice shall not be delayed.”",
            "16.  In the obtaining scenario, it would be fair and reasonable for both suits to be consolidated and heard together before a designated magistrate at Ndhiwa Principal Magistrate’s court being informed by sections 11,12, 13 ,15 and 18 (a) of the Civil Procedure Act Chapter 21 Laws of Kenya. In the case of Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Goldenberg Affair and 3-others vs Kilach 2003 KLR 249 at 265/266, it was observed;",
            "‘ …It would not be right for the two matters to be heard simultaneously by the High Court and the Commission….’",
            "17.   A fortiori, I am of the considered view that the application is partially unmerited. I hereby proceed to make the orders as follows;",
            "a)  Orders 1 and 2 sought therein and as stated at paragraph 1 (c) and (d) hereinabove, are hereby disallowed.",
            "b) Order 3 sought in the application, is hereby granted. For avoidance of doubt, it is further ordered that this suit generated by way of an originating summons dated 9th July 2020 and filed herein on 17th July 2020, be and is hereby transferred to Ndhiwa Principal Magistrate’s court and to be consolidated with Ndhiwa Principal Magistrate’s court Environment and Land case number 14 of 2020 ( The original file of the latter case is herewith returned to that court)  for hearing and determination by a designated magistrate.",
            "c)  Mention before the Principal Magistrate at Ndhiwa Law Courts on 9th February 2022 for directions",

            "The application dated 8th January, 2021 seeks the following orders:-",
            "1. The time to file the appellant’s Memorandum of Appeal be extended to 18th December, 2020 and the Memorandum of Appeal dated 16th December, 2020 and filed on 18th December, 2020 be deemed to be properly on record.",
            "2. The cost of this application be provided for. ",
            "The affidavit of Duncan Chengo of even date supports the application. The respondent filed a replying affidavit sworn on 10th June, 2021. The application was determined by way of written submissions.",
            "Counsel for the applicant submitted that the application seeks to enlarge time for the filing of the Memorandum of Appeal. The trial court had scheduled to deliver its ruling on 9th April, 2020. Due to Covid-19 pandemic, the courts operations were affected and no notice was issued on the next date for the delivery of the ruling. The applicant came to know about the ruling on 27th November, 2020 when police officers in the company of other people went to his place with the intention of enforcing the ruling. Counsel for the applicant managed to get a copy of the ruling on 14th December, 2020 and filed the Memorandum of Appeal on 18th December, 2020. Counsel later realized that the ruling had been delivered on 29th May, 2020.",
            " It was further submitted that counsel for the respondent wrote a letter dated 17th June 2020 requesting the court to issue a decree but the said letter was not copied to the applicant’s advocates. Counsel referred to the case of MASINDE MULIRO UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY –V- ALFATECH CONTRACTORS LIMITED; KENYA COMMERCIAL BANK & ANOTHER (GARNISHEE) (2021) eKLR where the court held:-",
            " “On the process of the extraction of the decree, and the subsequent application for execution, Order 21 Rule 8 of the Civil Procedure Rules is relevant. Rule 8 is about preparation of decrees and orders. For ease of reference, let me reproduce the relevant parts of it, which say…… My understanding of the provisions that I have cited above, is that the draft decree may be generated by either party. The provisions do not make it mandatory for the draft to come from the parties. A decree is an instrument that issues from the court, duly executed by the registrar and bearing the seal of the court. It is, therefore, a court instrument, issued at the instance of the court, as a purport of the outcome of court proceedings as set out in the judgment of the court. In an ideal situation, the decree should be generated by the court, but Rule 8 gives the parties an opportunity to initiate the process. Where they choose to initiate it, it becomes mandatory that the draft be placed before the other party for approval.",
            "Counsel for the applicant further argued that had the letter from the respondent’s counsel been copied to them, they would have become aware of the ruling and would have taken action. No e-mail was received from the court notifying them about the delivery of the ruling. Counsel relies on the case of TRAPEZE ASSOCIATES LIMITED –V- LUKAS ODHIAMBO ODODO & 3 OTHERS (2021) eKLR where it was held:-",
            "“The first issue to determine is whether the application has been filed within a reasonable time. The applicant has given several reasons why it was unable to access the ruling of the trial court. To the applicant the trial court was to blame as it did not email the same to the email it had provided. In the absence of any evidence of email, the court is inclined to believe the applicant. It is true that they had provided their email addresses and if for any reason they did not then it should be accorded a benefit of doubt. This position is buttressed by the fact that the application was made within a reasonable time in the circumstances which was about three weeks after the ruling was delivered. The court also takes judicial notice of the fact that most of our courts scaled down operations because of the Covid 19 pandemic.”",
            "Counsel for the applicant also referred to the case of EQUITY BANK LIMITED –V- RICHARD KEROCHI AYIERA (2020) eKLR where the court held:-",
            "“It is now well settled that the decision whether or not to extend the time for appealing is essentially discretionary. It is also well settled that in general the matters which this Court takes into account in deciding whether to grant an extension of time are first the length of the delay secondly, the reason for the delay, thirdly (possibly) the chances of the appeal succeeding if the application is granted and fourthly, the degree of prejudice to the respondent if the application is granted.",
            "On the reasons behind the delay, I considered the material availed to show that the impugned judgment was originally listed for delivery on 16th March, 2020 and yet it was delivered one (1) month later, and the explanation by the applicant that no judgment notice was served upon its advocate. I also considered the averment by the respondent that his advocate had served upon the applicant’s advocate a copy of the judgment soon thereafter and I looked at a copy of the correspondence dated 28th April, 2020 to that effect; however, I note that the said correspondence does not bear any indication that service was effected upon the applicant’s advocate. In the premises and upon further considering the prevailing circumstances resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, I find the explanation of the applicant to be reasonable.”",
            "According to the applicant, the application was filed without unreasonable delay. The applicant became aware of the ruling on 27th November, 2020, obtained a copy thereof on 4th December, 2020 and filed the Memorandum of Appeal on 18th December 2020. It is further argued that no prejudice will be suffered by the respondent as the appellant settled the decretal sum so as to avoid further execution. The appeal is not frivolous and the applicant is eager to pursue it. Counsel also cited the case of EDWARD KAMAU & ANOTHER –V- HANNAH MUKUI GICHUKI & ANOTHER (2015) eKLR where Aburili J. held:-",
            "“The right of appeal, it has been held time and again, is a Constitutional right which is the cornerstone of the rule of law. To deny a party that right, would in essence be denying them access to justice which is guaranteed under Article 48 of the Constitution and also a denial of a right to a fair hearing guaranteed under Article 50 (1) of the Constitution which latter right cannot be limited under Article 25 of the said Constitution. In my view, it has not been shown that the intended appeal is frivolous or a sham and therefore it is only fair and just that the applicants be accorded an opportunity to ventilate their grievances where they are aggrieved by a decision of the lower court, to challenge it before a superior court. By so doing, in my view, this court will be exercising its discretion judiciously to ensure that the applicants are not driven from the judgment seat even if there was some indolence leading to delay ",
            "The application is vehemently opposed. It is submitted that the applicant duly participated in the proceedings relating to a notice of motion date 18th November, 2019 before the trial court. Ruling was delivered on 29th may, 2020 and the applicant’s defence was struck out. The applicant proceeded to settle the entire decretal sum in Milimani MCCC No. 1965 of 2019 while the current application was pending. The settlement was unconditional. It is therefore argued that the intended appeal lacks merit, is a mere academic exercise and an abuse of the court process. The applicant admitted his indebtedness. The decretal sum was not paid into a joint account of both advocates. It is contended that the money was paid to the applicant for the respondent’s child therapy. The applicant admitted that he owed the amount and the issue of the effectiveness of the therapy was not raised before the trial court and is being raised for the first time. Counsel relies on the case of PERFECT SCAN LIMITED –V- HARRISON KAHINDI SAID (2021) eKLR where the court held:-",
            "“In any event, this court would be placed in an awkward situation were it to uphold the argument of the appellant where it is been called upon to decide on an issue which is raised for the first time on appeal. If this Court were to make a determination on the issue of jurisdiction on this appeal as urged by the appellant, this court would not be sitting on an appeal but be acting as a court of the first instance. This is because the issue of jurisdiction was not raised before the trial resident magistrate’s court. I say no more on that score. I will disallow the grounds of appeal on jurisdiction.”",
            "According to counsel for the respondent, if indeed the applicant wanted to avoid execution, he could have deposited the decretal sum in an interest earning joint account instead of fully settling the debt unconditionally. The applicant was well aware of the ruling date since the same was given in the presence of his advocates.",
            "The application is seeking extension of time to file a memorandum of appeal. The applicant is expected to explain the cause of the delay in filing the appeal. The explanation given is that after hearing the parties, the trial court scheduled its ruling for the 19th of April, 2020. No ruling was delivered on that date due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The applicant came to know that his defence was struck out and judgment entered when auctioneers went to his business premises on 27th November, 2020.",
            "In the case of KIRAGU –V- KIRAGU (1990) KLR 323 the Court of Appeal held:-",
            "“An application for an extension of time for lodging an appeal may be made even after the prescribed time has expired. However, failure by an applicant to explain away the delay in prosecuting his appeal may lead to the extension being refused.”",
            "In the case of GITHIAKA –V-NDUIGI (2004) 2KLR, 67 the Court of Appeal held:-",
            "“In the exercise of its discretion, the Court’s primary concern should be to do justice to the parties. The Court should, among other things consider:-",
            "- the length of the delay in lodging the notice and record of appeal;",
            "- where applicable, the delay in lodging the application for extension of time, as well as the explanation thereof;",
            "- whether or not the intended appeal is arguable; ",
            "- The prejudice to the respondent if the application is granted;",
            "- the public importance, if any, of the matter, and ",
            "- generally the requirements of the interest of justice in the case”",
            "The respondent contend that the appeal is an academic exercise since the entire decretal sum was fully paid unconditionally. On his part, the applicant contend that he paid the decretal sum to avoid further execution. None of the parties annexed the ruling of the trial court so as to enable this court consider whether the applicant’s defence raised triable issues. In my view the payment of a decretal sum by a judgment debtor does not erode that litigant’s constitutional right to pursue an appeal. Indeed such payment cements his position in that the need for orders staying execution would be dispensed with. The court should not be made to ponder as to what would happen should the appeal succeed and the respondent is not in a position to refund the decretal sum. The respondent was happy to execute and subsequently received the decretal sum while knowing that the applicant was pursuing an appeal. The issues to be determined in the appeal have nothing to do with the respondent’s ability or inability to refund the decretal sum. That in itself cannot be a good reason to stop the applicant from pursuing the appeal. The respondent is in a better position in that should the appeal fail, there would be no need to execute as the entire decretal sum has already been paid. Should the appeal succeed, the respondent would refund what he has received from the applicant.",
            "I do find that the explanation given by the applicant for the delay in filing the appeal is reasonable. There is no evidence that the applicant was aware as to when the ruling would have been delivered. Counsel for the respondent secretly obtained a decree without notifying the applicant’s counsel. Order 21 Rule 8 of the Civil Procedure Code states:-",
            "(1) A decree shall bear the date of the day on which the judgment was delivered.",
            "(2) Any party in a suit in the High Court may prepare a draft decree and submit it for the approval of the other parties to the suit, who shall approve it with or without amendment, or reject it, without undue delay; and if the draft is approved by the parties, it shall be submitted to the registrar who, if satisfied that it is drawn up in accordance with the judgment, shall sign and seal the decree accordingly.",
            "(3) If no approval of or disagreement with the draft decree is received within seven days after delivery thereof to the other parties, the registrar, on receipt of notice in writing to that effect, if satisfied that the draft decree is drawn up in accordance with the judgment, shall sign and seal the decree accordingly.",
            "(4) On any disagreement with the draft decree any party may file the draft decree marked as “for settlement” and the registrar shall thereupon list the same in chambers before the judge who heard the case or, if he is not available, before any other judge, and shall give notice thereof to the parties.",
            "(5) The provisions of sub-rules 2, 3 and 4 shall apply to a subordinate court and reference to the registrar and judge in the subrules shall refer to magistrate.",
            "(6) Any order, whether in the High Court or in a subordinate court, which is required to be drawn up, shall be prepared and signed in like manner as a decree.",
            "(7) Nothing in this rule shall limit the power of the court to approve a draft decree at the time of pronouncing judgment in the suit, or the power of the court to approve a draft order at the time of making the order.’",
            "Although Order 21 Rule 8 does not use the mandatory term “shall”, it does sets out the procedure to be used when preparing a decree. The respondent was equally expected to notify the applicant about the entry of judgment. The respondent has not explained how he ended up executing the decree, it appears that no proclamation was made. The extent of admission of the claim by the applicant has not been established as the defence and the ruling of the trial court have not been annexed.",
            "Therefore, the court will have to determine the appeal on its own merit after evaluating the record of the trial court. No prejudice will be suffered by the respondent who has already been paid the decretal sum.",
            "The upshot is that the application dated 8th January, 2021 is merited and the same is granted as prayed. The memorandum of Appeal filed on 18th December, 2020 is hereby deemed to be properly on record. Costs of the application shall abide the outcome of the appeal.",

            "(Being an appeal from the Judgment of Hon. S. Ndegwa (P.M.) ",
            "delivered on 1st December, 2020, in Githongo  PM ELC E004 OF 2020)",
            "JUDGMENT",
            "1. The appellants seek to overturn the order made by the lower court dismissing the preliminary objection dated 28.9.2020 and allowing the respondents application for injunction on the basis that: the respondent had no locus standi to institute the suit; no cause of action had been disclosed; customary trust could only be raised against a registered proprietor and not a lender; the applicants had not satisfied principle for grant of an injunction; the court was biased; the court allowed submissions from the bar based on unpleaded issues.",
            "2. This being a first appeal the court is mandated to re-assess and re-appraise itself with the lower court proceedings and come up with its own findings and conclusion so as to establish if the trial court based its findings on facts and the law.",
            "3. The respondent (as children of one Samuel Mureithi Magambo) deceased and registered owner of Parcel No. L.R No. Abothuguchi/Katheri/4882 based on intergenerational equity sued the 2nd appellant for charging the aforesaid land and obtaining Kshs. 500,000/= from the 1st appellant and in breach of their overriding rights and paying to clear the loan facility subsequent to which the 1st appellant caused the property to be advertised for auction sale for recovery of the loan.",
            "4. Alongside the plaint, the respondents brought a notice of motion seeking for temporary orders of injunction restraining the appellants from selling or disposing the suit land pending hearing of the suit alleging they came to know of the loan after their father passed on 31.3.2020 and when the 2nd appellant advertised it for auction sale on account of loan arrears, yet they had intergenerational equitable rights as their only homestead and inheritance.",
            "5. Interim orders were issued with interpartes hearing on 28.9.2020. The appellants entered appearance and by a replying affidavit sworn on 25.9.2020, they stated the deceased took a loan of Kshs. 500,000/= and offered the suit land as security, a charge was registered, a search established there were no encumbrances, the deceased fell into monthly instalment loan arrears of Kshs. 29,584/=, notices were sent over this default, a three months statutory notice was issued dated 17.6.2019, thereafter a 40 days’ notice of intention to sell was made after which a 45 days redemption notice and notification of sale was made.",
            "6. Further the appellants averred, in compliance with the law, a pre-auction valuation report was done after which advertisement for auction was made through newspapers for 24.1.2020.  Similarly the appellants alleged the deceased had previously filed Meru CMCC No. 11 of 2020 contesting the sale but withdrew the suit, and that since notices had been given during the lifetime of the deceased, there was no need to re-issue fresh statutory notices for the second time.",
            "7. Additionally the appellants stated the respondents had no documents to legally represent the estate of the deceased, could not demonstrate any relationship or trust between themselves and the 1st appellant who had a valid charge over the suit land, lacked any privity of contract with the 1st appellant, had no locus standi, were malicious and mischievous hence urged the suit be struck out with costs.",
            "8. The appellants attached a copy of the title deed, a letter of offer, a copy of a charge, copy of search notice, notification of sale, valuation report, newspaper advertisement and pleadings in the CMCC case marked as RK1 – 8 (a) respectively.",
            "9. The appellants also filed a notice of preliminary objection dated 28.9.2019 claiming the plaintiffs lacked locus standi to institute the suit and secondly that the suit offended Order 2 rule 15.",
            "10. Instead of filing a defence and counterclaim, the appellants filed a further list of documents dated 22.10.2020 which included a statement of defence filed in Meru CMCC ELC No. 11 of 2020.",
            "11. The trial court considered both the applications and the preliminary objection dated 28.9.2020, in which in a ruling read on 1.12.2020 dismissed the preliminary objection and proceeded to allow the application for temporary injunction.",
            "12. On the part of the appellant, it is submitted a customary claim can only be sustained against a registered proprietor and not a lender as per Isack Kieba M’Inanga –vs- Isaaya Theuri M’Lintari [2018] eKLR ruling; the court Under Order 2 rule 5 should have found no cause of action disclosed and that the respondents had not satisfied conditions in Mrao Ltd. –vs- First American Bank of Kenya & 2 Others [2003] eKLR, that tangible evidence of trust ought to have been availed as held in Paul Kirinya –vs-Delfina Kathiri [2019] [eKLR, that the consent of respondents was not required by the deceased to seek a loan as held in Jemutai Tanui –vs- Juliana Jeptepkeny & 5 Others [2013] eKLR; that land had become a commodity for sale as held in Elijah Kipng’eno Arap Bii –vs- Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd [2001] eKLR, that the court should not have allowed the respondent to submit on the issue of insurance without pleading it as held in Raila Amolo Odinga & Another –vs- IEBC & 2 Others [2017] eKLR.",
            "13. On the other hand, the respondents submit they had locus standi as beneficiaries with overriding rights under Section 28 (b) of Land Reform Act this being family land hence rely on Alfred Njau & 5 Others –vs- City Council of Nairobi [1983] eKLR on the proposition that as beneficial interested parties they had rights under the law to bring the suit on their own, and not as representatives of the estate.",
            "14. As regards the threshold for issuance of injunctive orders, the respondents submit, there was a threat to wrongly sell the suit land in total disregard of their overriding rights hence the trial court rightfully found they had established a prima facie case with a probability of success, had shown irreparable loss if their only homestead was auctioned which would not be compensated by way of damages and lastly the balance of convenience favoured them in granting the orders.",
            "ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS",
            "15. The appellants blame the trial court for entertaining the suit when the respondents lacked capacity to institute the suit over the suit land without requisite letters of administration on behalf of the estate of the deceased, through whom the 1st appellant had a privity of contract with.",
            "16. In Ragui –vs-Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd [2002] eKLR 647 the court held that when a chargor dies before a chargee has served upon him the statutory notice of sale, the chargee cannot purport to serve the same upon a deceased person. He has to serve it upon the executor or administrator of the estate of the chargor.",
            "17. Section 28 of the Land Registration Act 2012 provides a registered land shall be subject to trusts including customary trust which need not be noted in the register.",
            "18. In Mumo –vs- Makau (2002) 1EA 170, the court stated a trust was a question of fact to be proved through evidence and that under Sections 107 and 108 of the Evidence Act, the burden lies with the person asserting a fact to prove them.",
            "19. Given the foregoing, it is evident the issue of trust raised by the respondents could only be proved through viva voce evidence which the court could not possibly determine through a preliminary objection.",
            "20. The appellants filed no defence and or counterclaim denying the facts as pleaded by the respondents.  In absence of a defence, the trial court in my considered view was right to hold that there was need to have the matter heard on merits so that the respondents could prove their claim.",
            "21. In Susan Mumbi Waititu –vs- Mukuru Nduta & 4 Others [2007] eKLR the court held parties have to prove with cogent evidence that the suit premises was ancestral land and thus family land, passed over through the ages.",
            "22. Secondly, the appellants have submitted the trial court allowed submissions over unpleaded issue of the mortgage protection cover.  The replying affidavit sworn by Rebecca Kamau attached annexure marked RH 2(a). At page 10 thereof, the offer talks of a credit life insurance. This formed part of the court proceedings.  It was therefore perfectly within the respondents rights to submit on the issue.  The deceased signed the loan proposal form and the credit protection cover became automatic the moment the loan was approved.",
            "23. It is common knowledge such a policy crystalizes on the happening of death of an insured as held in Ann N. Parmena –vs- Housing Finance Co. of Kenya Ltd. [2015] eKLR.",
            "24. The 1st appellant did not notify the family as to what became of the loan protection cover upon the demise and the outstanding loan and if it had frozen the interest, as held in Housing Finance Company Ltd. –vs- Mary Wambui Muturi [2018] eKLR.",
            "25. Given the issues raised in the plaint and there being no defence, to counter the claims over trust, my considered view is that the trial court was right to find the respondents to have established legal rights under Section 28 of the Land Registration Act, Article 40 of the Constitution and Order 40 of the Civil Procedure Rules which as held in Mrao Ltd –vs- First American Bank Ltd called for rebuttal from the other appellants to respond.  The court guided by Section 1A, 1B & Article 159 of the Constitution sought to preserve the property pending the hearing and determination of the suit.",
            "26. In the premises my finding is the appeal herein lacks merit. The same is dismissed with costs.",

            "[a] The 6th respondent whether by himself or by his servants or agents or otherwise howsoever be temporarily restrained from selling, transferring and/or hiring to any third party and/or raising finances from an unsuspecting third party or in any other manner whatsoever using or dealing with Motor Vehicle Registration Number KCV 296R until the hearing and determination of this appeal.",
            "[b] On the grounds set forth in the annexed affidavit of Abdulkarim Juma Abdalla sworn on the 5th day of August 2021 and filed herein, this Court do, in the first instance, dispense with notice of this application to the respondents and make an interim order in terms of Prayer 1 until the inter-partes hearing of this application.",
            "[c] Directions be given for the service of the order made herein on the respondents, National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) and Master Fabricators Limited and for all necessary steps herein; and",
            "[d] That the costs of the application be costs in the Appeal.",
            "[2] The application was premised on the grounds that unless temporary injunction is granted the Appeal will be rendered nugatory; and that the Appeal is based on good arguable grounds and is, therefore, not frivolous or otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court. It was supported by the affidavit sworn on 5 August 2021 by the appellant’s Operations Manager, Abdulkarim Juma Abdalla, as well as the documents annexed thereto all marked as Exhibit “AJA1”.",
            "[3] It is manifest from the averments in the Supporting Affidavit, therefore, that the 1st respondent filed an action on 28 September 2016 in the Chief Magistrate’s Court at Kwale, being Civil Suit No. 470 of 2016 seeking general and special damages, interest and costs on behalf of the estate of Mwanakombo Omari, deceased, who died in a road accident on or about 22 May 2016. The 1st respondent had contended, in that suit, that the deceased’s death was attributable to the negligence of Seif Hemedi Mohamed (the 2nd respondent herein) and Tahmeed Coach Ltd (the appellant).",
            "[4] The appellant further averred that, in a Judgment delivered on 10 July 2019, the lower court found the 2nd respondent 100% liable for the accident and awarded the 1st respondent Kshs. 2,150,000/= as compensation for loss of dependency, pain and suffering and loss of expectation of life, together with interest and costs. Thereafter 1st respondent filed an application for execution of the ensuing Decree; whereupon Warrants of Attachment and Sale of the movable property of the appellant and 2nd respondent were issued authorizing the 4th respondent to attach and sell the property. Accordingly, the 4th respondent served a Proclamation of Attachment over the appellant’s Motor Vehicle Registration No. KCV 296R.",
            "[5] At paragraphs 12 to 20 of the Supporting Affidavit Mr. Abdalla averred that, although the appellant filed objections to the attachment, the same were ultimately dismissed; and that shortly thereafter, the 4th defendant seized the appellant’s motor vehicle in execution of the subject decree and sold it to the 5th respondent. He further stated that, while they were awaiting the ruling of the lower court, which had been slated for 10 March 2021, he got to learn, upon checking the appellant’s NTSA-TIMS Account, that ownership of the subject motor vehicle had been transferred to the 5th respondent. The appellant then sought a reversal of that transfer vide an application under Certificate of Urgency filed on 16 February 2021, but even that last-ditch attempt was thwarted when the application was dismissed on 9 June 2021. Thereupon, the appellant filed the instant appeal, with the conviction that it has good chances of success.",
            "[6] In addition to the application dated 5 August 2021, the appellant filed an application dated 12 August 2021 seeking that the Officer in Charge of the nearest police station to the location where Motor Vehicle KCV 296R was domiciled, be ordered to move the said motor vehicle to Central Police Station, Mombasa, for safe custody. The application was expressed to have been made under Section 3A of the Civil Procedure Act in the interest of justice. In the Supplementary Affidavit sworn in support of the 2nd application by Mr. Abdalla, he indicated that the motor vehicle was on the verge of being rebranded at Master Fabricators Limited where it was; and that ownership had changed from the 5th to 6th respondent. He further averred that he received information from the Managing Director of Master Fabricators Limited that he was under pressure from the 6th defendant to release the motor vehicle. He was therefore apprehensive that the motor vehicle would be released and taken to a decision unknown to the appellant. This is what informed the filing of the 2nd application by the appellant.",
            "[7] A perusal of the court record shows that interim orders were issued as prayed in the two applications. In respect of the application dated 5 August 2021, the formal order was issued on 10 August 2021 thus:",
            "[a] that in the interim the Sixth Respondent whether by himself or by his servants or agents or otherwise howsoever be temporarily restrained from selling, transferring and/or hiring to any third party and/or raising finances from an unsuspecting third party and/or in any other manner whatsoever using or dealing with motor vehicle registration number KCV 296R until the inter-partes hearing and determination of the aforesaid Notice of Motion.",
            "[b] That the Respondents be served with the said Notice of Motion for inter-partes hearing on 19th day of August 2021 before the duty judge.",
            "[8] Likewise, interim orders were issued following the filing of the 2nd application thus:",
            "[a] That interim orders that the motor vehicle Registration Number KCV 296R be deposited at the Central Police Station, Mombasa under the custody of the OCS at the applicant’s cost pending inter partes hearing.",
            "[b] That the OCS of the nearest police station to where the motor vehicle Registration Number KCV 296R is currently domiciled to provide security in transit to Central Police Station, Mombasa.",
            "[9] The 1st respondent, Ali Mabruki Mwaguta, opposed the application. He relied on his own Replying Affidavit, sworn on 1 October 2021. He respondent to both applications and pointed out that they are both spent as the orders prayed for have already been granted. He nevertheless complained that substantive prayers were given that involved the movement of the subject motor vehicle to Central Police Station, Mombasa, without his involvement. He cited Article 48 of the Constitution and posited that he was, in the circumstances, condemned unheard in contravention of the rules of natural justice. He further averred that it was imperative for the appellant to first prove the allegations of fraud; and that since no such proof was availed, the Court has no basis for granting the prayers sought in the 1st application dated 5 August 2021. He consequently prayed for the dismissal of that application.",
            "[10] On behalf of the 3rd respondent, a Replying Affidavit was sworn by Simon Mwangi on 5 October 2021, basically supporting the position taken by the appellant in its Supporting Affidavit. Mr. Mwangi further averred that, pursuant to the banker-customer relationship, the appellant had approached the 3rd respondent for an asset-financing arrangement, and was accordingly facilitated in connection with the purchase of Motor Vehicle Registration No. KCV 296R. He further averred that the said motor vehicle was offered as security for the facility; and therefore that the 3rd respondent was consequently registered as co-owner of the motor vehicle. He was thus of the posturing that the motor vehicle was never available for attachment in the first place.",
            "[11] In addition, it was the assertion of Mr. Mwangi that, although the 3rd respondent was a co-owner of the subject motor vehicle, it was neither impleaded in the Kwale suit, No. 470 of 2016, nor served with any Proclamation of Attachment. He likewise propounded the view that the attachment and sale of the subject motor vehicle was unlawful and, therefore that the appellant is entitled to an injunction pending the hearing and determination of the appeal. He added that the 3rd respondent stands to suffer irreparable loss should the orders prayed for not be granted.",
            "[12] On her part, the 5th respondent, Evaline Njeri, contended that she bought the subject motor vehicle at a public auction conducted on 7 October 2020 for Kshs. 3,500,000/=; and that she, in turn, sold the motor vehicle to the 6th respondent herein. She therefore asserted that the 6th respondent is a bona fide purchaser for value and therefore has a right to ownership and quiet possession of the asset. She pointed out that attempts by the appellant to challenge the sale were all dismissed and her ownership confirmed. She accordingly took the view that the instant application and the appeal itself are all part of the appellant’s futile design at staying a negative order; which is impermissible.",
            "[13]  In response to the applications application, the 6th respondent filed his own Replying Affidavit sworn on 18 August 2021. He averred therein that he has a right under Article 40 of the Constitution of Kenya to legally acquire and own property; and therefore as he was not a party to the lower court suit, his possession of the motor vehicle, as a purchaser for value, is impeccable. According to him, the application for temporary injunction is untenable in his case. He further impugned his joinder contending that it was not only unprocedural, but was also done in abuse of the process of the Court in that no leave was applied for or obtained before his joinder.",
            "[14]  The two applications were canvassed by way of written submissions, pursuant to the directions given on 29 September 2021. On behalf of the appellant, written submissions were filed herein on 29 September 2021. In a bid to demonstrate that the appeal is arguable, counsel for the appellant went into great detail on the merits of the appeal. For instance, at paragraphs 9 to 13, counsel for the appellant urged that the entire process of sale of the subject motor vehicle was flawed; and therefore that the lower court ought not to have sanctified the same by disallowing the objections raised by the appellant. He further argued that, having demonstrated that the motor vehicle had been repainted and renamed, sufficient justification had been made for the issuance of temporary injunction as the 6th defendant’s financial ability is unknown to the appellant. Hence, counsel urged the Court to find that the appellant stands to suffer irreparable loss should the 6th respondent’s intention to remove the motor vehicle from Master Fabricators Ltd.",
            "[15]  In response to the averment that the 6th respondent has been wrongly enjoined to this appeal, counsel for the appellant took the view that, since the 6th respondent stands to be affected by the ultimate orders of the Court on appeal, it is only fair and just that he participates in the appeal. The appellant proceeded to take advantage of the provisions of Order 42 Rule 3 of the Civil Procedure Rules, by amending its Memorandum of Appeal to include the 6th respondent as a necessary party. Counsel further proposed and prayed that leave be granted vide this ruling, should the Court find that leave is necessary. Counsel relied on several authorities, as set out at paragraphs 18 of his written submissions.",
            "[16] With regard to the contention by the 5th and 6th respondents that they acquired good title to the motor vehicle, Mr. Wangila took the stance that whether or not the 6th respondent was a bona fide purchaser for value is irrelevant; and that the question to pose was whether the 5th respondent had a valid title to pass to him. Counsel relied on Rajendra Sanghani & Another (suing as administrators of the Estate of Ratilal Gordhandas Sanghani) vs. Fairmile Investments Limited & Another [2021] eKLR in which it was held that the principle of innocent purchaser for value does not give validity to an invalid title.",
            "[17]  In the premises, Mr. Wangila urged the Court to find that the appeal is arguable and is therefore not at all frivolous; and that unless the injunctive orders sought are granted, the appeal will not only be rendered nugatory, but the appellant will also suffer irreparable loss and damage. He thus prayed that the interim orders granted to the appellant on 9th and 12th August 2021 be confirmed pending the hearing and determination of the appeal.",
            "[18]  On his part, Mr. Ogutu for the 6th proposed two issues for determination, in his written submissions filed on 28 September 2021, namely, whether the 6th respondent was procedurally enjoined in the appeal and the present applications; and whether the 6th respondent is an innocent purchaser for value whose right to property is protected under Article 40 of the Constitution of Kenya. Counsel made reference to Order 1 Rule 10(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules which the appellant relied on and submitted that the said provision, by employing words like “plaintiff” and “defendant” is explicit that its drafters intended such joinder at the early stages of a suit and not on appeal. He also urged the position that a formal application for leave is a prerequisite before joinder; and therefore that it is unprocedural for a party to be joined for the first time on appeal and without leave. Counsel relied on Francis Kariuki Muruatetu & Another vs. Republic & 5 Others [2016] eKLR to buttress his arguments.",
            "[19] In support of the submission that the 6th respondent is an innocent purchaser for value whose right is protected under Article 40 of the Constitution, counsel made reference to Lawrence Mukiri vs. Attorney General & 4 Others [2013] eKLR to back up his assertion that the appellant is not entitled to the orders sought; and therefore that the application ought to be dismissed with costs.",
            "[20] Having given due consideration to the applications, the averments in the various affidavits filed by the parties as well as the written submissions put in by their counsel, it is plain that most of the facts are not in contest. A perusal of the court record confirms that the appellant has indeed appealed the decision of Hon. Wambugu, SRM, in Kwale Civil Suit No. 470 of 2016 dated 9 June 2021. A copy of the said decision is annexed at pages 265 to 270 of the appellant’s Exhibit 1 to the Supporting Affidavit. It is also not in dispute that the 1st respondent sued the appellant and the 2nd respondent in the Kwale matter; and that Judgment was entered in the 1st respondent’s favour in the sum of Kshs. 2,150,000/=.",
            "[21] It is likewise not disputed that in execution of the decree issued in the Kwale matter, the 4th respondent attached motor vehicle Registration No. KCV 296R. The appellant and the 3rd respondent have all along been of the view, and still contend, that the said motor was not available for attachment and/or sale; granted that it was purchased through an asset financing arrangement; and was therefore registered in the joint names of the appellant, as the purchaser, and the 3rd respondent, as the financier. Nevertheless, the motor vehicle was sold to the 5th respondent who later sold it to the 6th respondent. Thus, the current registered owner of the subject motor vehicle is the 6th respondent; and it was on this account that he was enjoined to this appeal as the 6th respondent. Needless to repeat that the 6th respondent has strenuously objected to his joinder herein.",
            "[22] It is a fact that the appellant has challenged the decision of the lower court vide this appeal and in its Memorandum of Appeal, it has faulted the lower court for, inter alia, holding that the transfer of the motor vehicle to the 6th respondent was above board. The appellant therefore seeks interim intervention by way of an injunction pending the hearing and determination of the appeal. As was noted by the 1st respondent, the appellant’s 2nd application is spent in that both prayers were granted on 12 August 2021. The subject motor vehicle has since been moved to Central Police Station, Mombasa, for safe custody.",
            "[23]  Accordingly, in respect of the 1st application, the issues that arise for determination are:",
            "[a] Whether the appellant has made out a good case for the issuance of temporary injunction pending the hearing and determination of the appeal;",
            "[b] Whether the 6th respondent is a proper party to this appeal.",
            "[24]  In respect of the first issue, Order 42 Rule 6(6) of the Civil Procedure Rules provides that:",
            "“Notwithstanding anything contained in subrule (1) of this rule the High Court shall have power in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction to grant a temporary injunction on such terms as it thinks just provided the procedure for instituting an appeal from a subordinate court or tribunal has been complied with.”",
            "[25]  Generally speaking, the grant of a temporary injunction has been guided by the principles laid down in Giella vs. Cassman Brown & Co. Ltd [1973] EA 358, in which it was held that:",
            "\"The conditions for the grant of an interlocutory injunction are...well settled in East Africa. First, an applicant must show a prima facie case with a probability of success. Secondly, an interlocutory injunction will not normally be granted unless the applicant might otherwise suffer irreparable injury, which would not adequately be compensated by an award of  damages. Thirdly, if the court is in doubt, it will decide an  application on the balance of convenience.\"",
            "[26]  As to what amounts to a prima facie case, the Court of Appeal, in Mrao Ltd vs. First American Bank of Kenya Ltd & 2 Others [2003] KLR 123 held that:",
            "\"A prima facie case in a civil application includes but not confined to a genuine and arguable case. It is a case in which on the material presented to the Court a tribunal properly directing itself will conclude that there exists a right which has apparently been infringed by the opposite party as to call for an explanation or rebuttal from the latter.\"",
            "[27]  It is now trite that, in determining whether or not the appellant has an arguable appeal, the Court need not examine the merits of the appeal too closely; but it must, nevertheless, be satisfied that there is an arguable appeal. The Court of Appeal made this point in Nguruman Limited vs. Jan Bonde Nielsen & 2 Others, Civil Appeal No. 77 of 2012, when it held that:",
            "“We reiterate that in considering whether or not a prima facie case has been established, the court does not hold a mini trial and must not examine the merits of the case closely. All that the court is to see is that on the face of it the person applying for an injunction has a right, which has been or is threatened with violation. Positions of the parties are not to be proved in such a manner as to give a final decision in discharging a prima facie case. The applicant need not establish title it is enough if he can show that he has a fair and bona fide question to raise as to the existence of the right, which he alleges. The standard of proof of that prima facie case is on a balance or, as otherwise put, on a preponderance of probabilities. This means no more than that the Court takes the view that on the face of it the applicant’s case is more likely than not to ultimately succeed.”",
            "[28]  A perusal of the Memorandum of Appeal does reveal several arguable points, including the all-important question of whether the 5th respondent had a valid title to convey to the 6th respondent. The appeal is therefore not an idle appeal. It is also manifest, from the affidavits filed in respect of the 2nd application that the subject motor vehicle was in the process of being rebranded and that, whereas it was allegedly sold for Kshs. 3,600,000/= the appellant bought it in July 2019 as a new unit from Scania East Africa Limited at USD 207,094.27. It is manifest therefore that, should the motor vehicle be disposed of as proposed by the respondents, the appellant will forever lose not only his right to the motor vehicle, but will also be left to shoulder the obligation of paying off the facility it obtained from the 3rd respondent to purchase the motor vehicle. Clearly therefore the appellant stands to suffer irreparable harm.",
            "[29]  As to the balance of convenience, it was shown that the motor vehicle has already been transferred, at the instance and expense of the appellant, to Central Police Station at Mombasa. Thus, the balance of convenience as it stands is in favour of the appellant; while at the same time ensuring that the respondents will not be unduly prejudiced.",
            "[30]  As for the joinder of the 6th respondent, the Court’s attention was drawn to the provisions of Order 1 Rule 10(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules which permits the joinder of any party whose presence is necessary for the effectual adjudication of the dispute. I agree therefore with the argument advanced by counsel for the 6th defendant that the joinder envisaged under Order 1 Rule 10(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules is the joinder for purposes of primary proceedings at the commencement of a civil dispute. Nevertheless, joinder of interested parties now has constitutional underpinning from the standpoint of Article 50(1) of the Constitution. To that end, Rule 5(d)(ii) of the Constitution of Kenya (Protection of Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) Practice and Procedure Rules, 2013, recognizes that:",
            "“The Court may at any stage of the proceedings, either upon or without the application of either party, and on such terms as may appear just …order that the name of any party person who ought to have been joined, or whose presence before the court may be necessary in order to enable the court adjudicate upon and settle the matter, be added.”",
            "[31]  It is manifest therefore that there is no impediment to joinder, even on appeal, of any party who is likely to be affected by the outcome of the decision of the Court, such as the 6th respondent in this case. Hence, the argument by counsel for the 6th respondent, that a formal application is a prerequisite, is untenable. In any event, the appellant has shown that it effected the joinder by way of amendment of the Memorandum of Appeal pursuant to Order 42 Rule 3 of the Civil Procedure Rules, which provides that:",
            "“The appellant may amend his memorandum of appeal without leave at any time before the court gives directions under rule 13.”",
            "[32]  In Hamisi Yawa & Others vs. Tsanga Ngala Chome & Others [2018] eKLR the Court of Appeal underscored the rationale for joinder thus:",
            "“The rationale behind the joinder of any party to proceedings is to have on board a necessary party for purposes of determining the real issues in dispute. Perhaps, this is reason behind the general guiding principle that joinder of a party like amendment of pleadings, should be freely allowed and at any stage of the proceedings, provided that it will not result in prejudice or injustice to the other party which cannot properly be compensated in costs…we find that the applicants have made out a case to warrant their joinder in the appeal against the impugned judgment. We say so, because as we set out in the opening paragraph of this ruling, at the heart of the dispute between the parties is the determination of the ownership and entitlement of the suit parcel. Accordingly, the participation of the applicants who claim to be in occupation and entitled to the suit parcel is integral in the conclusive determining the aforementioned issue.",
            "[33]  To emphasize the centrality of the right to be heard, the Court of Appeal relied on Mbaki & Others vs. Macharia & Another [2005] 2 EA 206, in which it was held thus:",
            "“The right to be heard is a valued right. It would offend all notions of justice if the rights of a party were to be prejudiced or affected without the party being afforded an opportunity to be heard.”",
            "[34]  It is in the light of the foregoing that I find the joinder of the 6th respondent proper. The protestations of the 6th respondent as to his joinder to this appeal are therefore baseless; particularly considering his admission at paragraph 7 of his Replying Affidavit that he relied on the ruling of the lower court to satisfy himself that the 5th respondent had a good title to the motor vehicle.",
            "[35]  In the result, the appellant’s 1st application dated 5 August 2021 is hereby allowed and orders granted as hereunder:",
            "[a] That the 6th respondent whether by himself or by his servants or agents or otherwise howsoever be temporarily restrained from selling, transferring and/or hiring to any third party and/or raising finances from an unsuspecting third party or in any other manner whatsoever using or dealing with Motor Vehicle Registration Number KCV 296R until the hearing and determination of this appeal.",
            "[b] That this Order be served forthwith on all the respondents as well as the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) and the Officer in Charge, Central Police Station, Mombasa in whose custody the subject motor vehicle is presently.",
            "[c] The cost of the application be costs in the Appeal.",
            "It is so ordered.",

            "RULING",
            "1. Through an undated letter received by court on the 5th of November 2021 the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution sought to have the decision of the trial magistrate in Chief Magistrate Court Case No. E1234 of 2021 – Republic vs Khadija Abdikadir Hassan revised so that the accused in the said case is repatriated back to Somalia as opposed to the Hagadera Refugee camp within Dadaab.",
            "2. In the above case the accused faced three charges; making a document contrary to Section 357 of the Penal Code. Secondly uttering a false document contrary to Section 357(b) of the Penal Code. Thirdly, being unlawfully in Kenya contrary to Section 53(2) of the Kenya Citizenship and Immigration Act.",
            "3. The accused pleaded guilty to all the three counts. She was fined Kshs.20,000 in default 1-year imprisonment on Count 1 and 2. On Count 3 the trial Magistrate directed that accused be escorted back to Hagadera Refugee Camp on completion of the sentence in counts 1 & 2.",
            "4. The court being desirous of more information on the accused having noted from the proceedings that the accused had informed the trial court of her wish to go back to the Hagadera Refugee Camp, directed for a background check on the accused. A report was prepared by Probation and Aftercare Services and accordingly filed in court.",
            "5. According to the report the accused person’s parents came to Kenya as refugees in 1992 and lived in Hagadera Refugee Camp as refugees. They came with their 4 children the accused being the 3rd born. When the family relocated the accused was 1 year old. She is now 26 years.",
            "Her mother and siblings all live at the Hagadera Refugee Camp. She left the camp upon getting married. She has since separated with her husband and has 2 children aged 3 and 10 months.",
            "She is a registered refugee.",
            "She has no family in Somalia.",
            "6. Over a period of time Kenya as a country has hosted refugees from neighbouring countries, some of which include Sudan, Ethiopia, Eretria, Rwanda, Burundi and Somalia.",
            "7. As was stated in Kenya National Human Rights Commission and Kituo Cha Sheria vs The Attorney General & 4 Others Constitutional Petition No. 227 of 2014. The main treaties governing the issue of refugees are the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of the Refugees and the 1967 Optional Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. There are also a host of other international instruments that discuss this subject.",
            "Kenya as a State acceded to the 1951 United Nations Convention on the status of refugees on 16th May, 1966 and the 1967 Protocol in 1981. Kenya is also a State party to the Organization of African Union (OAU) now AU Convention on Specific aspects of Refugees in Africa which it signed in 1969 and ratified in June 1992. Kenya also acceded to the convention against torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in February 1997.",
            "8. The major principle in the protection of refugees which is addressed by the various conventions is the non-refoulment principle which speaks to the obligation by States actors not to return refugees back to a place that threatens their freedom or lives.",
            "9. Kenya went further as a country beyond ratification of the instruments mentioned above to enacted the Refugee Law on the 30th of December 2006, which Act commenced operation on the 15th of May 2007 and  which act was necessitated by the influx of the refugee population in the country and “for the recognition, protection and management of refugees….”",

            "10.  Refugees are subject to the Laws of the host country which explains why the court punished the accused for Count 1 & 2",
            "11.  The accused was not unlawfully in Kenya as she is a registered refugee but was not within the confines of the refugee camp. The trial court in its wisdom ordered repatriation to the camp upon payment of the fine or having served the 1-year sentence.",
            "12.   As it were, Kenya is under an obligation to protect and treat refugees humanely. It is not a secret that though Somalia as a nation is slowly returning to normalcy it is still volatile and hundreds of its nationals still being held at the refugee camps.",
            "The accused did not tell the court that she wishes to return to Somalia in the current state of that country.  She expressed her wish to go back to the refugee camp.  On what basis would Kenya be repatriating her back to Somalia?",

            "RULING",
            "1. The above mentioned two suits were consolidated on 21.6.2021 following an application made by the Defendants dated 22.4.2021. On 14.2.2019, the case of Bernard Mwangi Nderitu, 1st Plaintiff in ELC Case No. 5 of 2010 was marked as withdrawn. The court was also informed that the 6th Plaintiff in the same file died on 4.11.2012. Coming up for determination is a Notice of Motion application dated 19th July 2021 brought forth by Applicants who are represented by N. Owino, advocate for 5th Plaintiff. The court will also determine the Preliminary Objection filed by the defendant dated 27.9.2021.",
            "Case for the Applicants",
            "2.  The Notice of Motion dated 19th July 2021 seeks the following orders:",
            "i. Spent",
            "ii. That the Applicants be granted leave to amend the Originating Summon in terms of the annexed amended draft.",
            "iii. That the amended originating summons dated the 31st day of May 2021 and filed on the 2nd day of June 2021 be deemed to be properly on record.",
            "iv. That cost of the Application be in the cause.",
            "3. This application is premised on the grounds on the face of the application and on the supporting affidavit of Norah Owino counsel for the Applicants. The Applicants aver that when the suit was instituted, the Plaintiffs were officials of Saikoma Self Help Group but have since been ousted and were being uncooperative. Counsel added that despite the Plaintiffs being officials of the said self-help group, they filed the suit in their personal capacity.",
            "4.  The submissions of the Applicants are dated 14th October 2021, where a back ground history of the suit has been given. That when this file and ELC No. 128 of 2020 were consolidated, they were asked by court to file joint originating summons and other pleadings but this was not realised because the advocates representing the parties did not agree on joint pleadings. This resulted to the consent order to substitute Plaintiffs being set aside. Counsel indicated that when the consent was set aside, they had already filed the amended pleadings and other supporting documents. It is submitted that the amendment was necessary as it brought on board officials acting on behalf of Saikoma Self Help Group who could ably prosecute the suit.",
            "5.  In support of their case, the Applicants made reference to the case of Julia Akello Kunguru v Seth Lugonzo and Kenya Tourist Development Corporation H.C. Milimani Civil Suit No. 197 of 2001 where Justice Ringera allowed amendment to pleadings stating that amendments to pleadings should be freely given at any stage so long as the other party is not prejudiced… The case of City Clock Ltd v County Clock Kenya Ltd and Bonface Mnange Kitiro (2020) which laid out principles governing amendment of pleadings was also referred to.",
            "6. It was further submitted that the Defendant’s preliminary objection was not on a point of law but facts that require evidence and should be dismissed citing the case of Mukisa Biscuit Manufacturing Company Ltd v West-End Distributors (1969) EA 696.",
            "Case for the 2nd - 4th Plaintiffs",
            "7. On 4.10.2021, the day the court gave directions on the prosecution of the application dated 19.7.2021, Mr. Nyamberi appeared for the 2nd- 4th Plaintiffs and he indicated that they opposed the aforementioned application of which they had filed grounds of opposition as well as a Preliminary Objection both dated 29.9.2021. However, no such documents could be traced in the courts CTS system or in the physical file.",
            "Case for the Defendant",
            "8. In opposition to the application, the Defendants have filed a rather lengthy affidavit of one Alfred Kariuki who identifies himself as the director of the Defendant. The issues raised therein are in essence recapped in the Preliminary Objection. The Defendant contends that Advocate N. Owino was only representing the 5th Plaintiff hence, she cannot purport to bring forth an amendment of the plaint without consensus with the other Plaintiffs and that the claim remains that of adverse possession and not a representative suit.",
            "9.  The grounds raised in the Preliminary Objection dated 27th September 2021 are summarised as follows:",
            "i. The Application is frivolous, vexatious and a gross abuse of the Court Process, as the Applicant has not been properly or clearly identified.",
            "ii. The matters raised in the application are res judicata having been the subject matter of an application dated 1st February 2015, which application was disposed of by way of a consent that was recorded in open court before Honourable Eboso J. on 28th January 2021.",
            "iii. The suit was filed by persons on their own behalf and was not a representative suit and removing/ adding other persons was prejudicial to the defendant.",
            "iv. Moses Kamuri Kingora and Stephen Kamau are named in ELC No. 128 of 2020 as the 5th and 11th Defendants respectively. They have filed a Statement of Defence and Counterclaim dated 4th December 2020.",
            "v. Allowing the proposed Plaintiffs in ELC no.5 of 2010 to unilaterally amend pleadings in ELC No. 5 of 2010 in which none were initially named as parties, while they have already ventilated their claim to the suit land through their Counterclaim in ELC NO. 128 OF 2020 will result in them having two different sets of pleadings concerning the same matter.",
            "10. The defendants filed their submissions dated 15th October 2021 raising the following three issues: whether the applicants have locus to file the instant application; whether the application was res judicata and whether the application had met the threshold to warrant court’s discretion to grant to leave.",
            "11. On the issue of locus, it was submitted that the Plaintiffs did not have locus to institute the suit as had been established in Supreme Court case of Mumo Matemu v Trusted Society of Human Rights Alliance & 5 others (2014) eKLR and Daykio Plantations Ltd v National Bank of Kenya Ltd & 2 others (2019) eKLR. It was submitted that the suit had been instituted by 6 people yet the application to amend the suit had the effect of bringing new Parties/Plaintiffs.",
            "12. On the issue of res judicata, it was submitted that the Plaintiffs had been given an opportunity to amend their pleadings but did not do so, thus the consent order was set aside and matter set down for hearing. To this end, reference was made to the provisions of  Section 6 of the Civil Procedure Act and the cases of;  ANM v PMN (2016) eKLR & Invesco Assurance Company Ltd & 2 others v Auctioneers Licensing Board & Another; Kinyanjui Njuguna & Company Advocates & Another (interested parties) (2020) eKLR.",
            "13. It was further submitted that the law on amendment of pleadings was settled in Elijah Kipng’eno Arap Bii v Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd (2013) eKLR, Rubina Ahmed & 3 others v Guardian Bank Ltd (sued in its capacity as a successor in title to first National Finance Bank Ltd) (2019) eKLR and Anders Bruel T/A Queenscross Avitaition v Nyambura Musyimi & 2 others (2017) eKLR in which the common factor was that amendment of pleadings should be timeous and made in good faith.",
            "14.  It was also submitted that the suit was filed in 2010 but the said self-help group was registered in 2011 as per the certificate of registration and this was a misrepresentation which was against the set principles for amendment. Defendant contends that the issue of amendment had not been timeous because, not only was counsel for Applicants given an opportunity to amend the pleadings but failed to do so, but the change in leadership as claimed took place in 2013 and they had an opportunity to amend the pleadings since that time.",
            "15.  In conclusion, Defendant submitted that the amendment would change the suit from being a personal suit to a representative suit and that the proposed Plaintiffs were Defendants in ELC No. 128 of 2020, where they have already filed their defence and counterclaim. As such the proposed amendment was an abuse of court process and should be dismissed with costs.",
            "Analysis and determination",
            "16. This court finds that the issues for determination are:",
            "i. Whether the Defendant’s preliminary objection is merited. ",
            "ii. Whether the Applicants should be granted leave to amend the originating summons.",
            "17. It has been said time and again that a preliminary objection should be raised on purely points of law and not on facts that require evidence as outlined in the case of Mukisa Biscuit Manufacturing Co. Ltd vs West End Distributors Ltd (1969) EA 696. Without making pronouncements on the issues raised in the preliminary objection since they are at the core of the Notice of Motion application, this court finds that they all require evidence for court to ascertain their veracity. As such, they do not meet the set out principles for preliminary objections. Instead, the court will treat the preliminary objection as a response by the Defendant to the current application.",
            "18. The second issue for consideration is whether the application dated 19.7.2021 should be allowed. The gist of the application is that the Plaintiffs had instituted the suit in their own capacity and ought to be replaced by officials of Saikoma Self Help Group because they are the elected representatives of people residing on the suit land hence the need for the amendment.",
            "19.  Order 8 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 comprehensively covers amendment of pleadings. Rule 3 thereof provides that;",
            "“  …  the court may at any stage of the proceedings, on such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just and in such manner as it may direct, allow any party to amend his pleadings”.",
            "20. There is no controversy that on 28th January 2021 this court granted a consent order in the following words:",
            "By Consent:",
            "1. The Plaintiff in the OS dated 8th January 2010 shall be amended to include the following persons as Plaintiffs: Moses Kamuri Kingo, Josephine Kung’u Kimani (all suing on behalf of Saikoma Self Help Group); Hesborn Omondi; Francis Rumano; Peter Wambugu. ",
            "2. The list of Defendants in Nairobi ELC No. 128 of 2020 shall be amended to include all the Plaintiffs in the amended originating summons.",
            "3. In order to give effect to order No. 1, all advocates for the current Plaintiffs No. 2, 3, 4, and 5 together with all the new Plaintiffs shall within 30 days from today file and serve a joint amended O.S together with all supporting affidavits, lists and bundle of documents and list and witness statements. ",
            "4. Upon service of the documents listed in 3 above, the advocate for the Defendant shall file and serve a replying affidavit in O.S No. 5/2010 as well as an amended plaint in ELC No. 128/2020 within 30 days of service.",
            "5. The replying affidavit shall be filed together with witness statements and list and bundle of documents.",
            "6. Upon service of the amended plaint in Nairobi ELC 128/2020, the Defendants shall be at liberty to file defences or amended defences together with bundle of written statements and documentary evidence.",
            "7. Upon close of pleadings the two suits i.e. ELC O.S. NO. 5/2010 and ELC No. 128/2020 shall be consolidated and heard together” .",
            "21. The Plaintiffs in ELC Case No. 5 of 2010 failed or neglected to comply with the consent order leading to the setting aside of the said consent on 21st June 2021. Having failed to abide by the order to amend pleadings and join additional Plaintiffs, counsel for the 5th Plaintiff has now filed the current application seeking for the same orders to amend the Originating Summons. Order 8 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules is very clear on what happens after lapse of time given for amendment of pleadings:",
            " “ Where the court has made an order giving any party leave to amend, unless that party amends within the period specified or, if no period is specified, within fourteen days, the order shall cease to have effect, without prejudice to the power of the court to extend the period” . ",
            "22. The Court of Appeal in Joseph ochieng & 2 others Trading as Aquiline Agencies v First National Bank of Chicago [1995] eKLR cited in concurrence the case of Ketteman vs Hansel Properties Limited (1988) 1 ALL ER 3S at page 62 that,",
            " “…Whether an amendment should be granted is a matter for the discretion of the trial judge and he should be guided in the exercise of the discretion by his assessment of where justice lies. Many and diverse factors will bear on the exercise of this discretion…”",
            "23. It is not refuted that the rules of amendment of pleadings are underpinned on principles of justice and fairness, however these principles should not be invoked at whim by parties whose doings or misdeeds drive them from the seat of justice. From the court record, it is clear that counsel for the 5th Plaintiff had been given an opportunity by this court to amend the pleadings as well as enjoin other persons as Plaintiffs in the suit, but squandered that opportunity without reasonable cause and now beseeches the same court to grant it the same orders.",
            "24. This court is moved and again reproduces the holding of the above cited case of Joseph ochieng & 2 others Trading v First National Bank of Chicago where Justice A.B. Shah stated:",
            "“… All in all the conduct of plaintiffs’ case has been so slovenly that it would be impossible now to have a fair trial if the proposed amendments were  allowed … Ransley and Another vs  K.N.C.C.  Ltd Civil Application No.  NAI 116 of 1988 (Unreported): ",
            "\"Another factor that a judge must weigh in the balance is the pressure on the courts caused by the great increase in litigation and the consequent necessity that, in the interests of the whole community, legal business should be conducted efficiently. I can no longer afford to show the same indulgence towards the negligent conduct of litigation as was perhaps possible in a more leisured age. There will be cases in which justice will be better served by allowing the consequences of the negligence of the lawyers to fall on their own heads ...\"",
            "25. It is noted that an application dated 1.2.2015 seeking more or less similar orders had marked time in this file for 5 (five) years until 26.11.2020 when the court was moved to give directions on its prosecution.",
            "26.  Further, upon analysing the proposed Amended Originating Summons, the court notes that the applicants proposes to remove all the Plaintiffs in the original pleadings save the 5th Plaintiff (Stephen Kamau) and replace them with others who are: Moses Kamuri King’ora, and Joshua Kung’u Kimani. The question begging for an answer is, who is/are the Applicants. After all, none of the Applicants, not even the 5th Plaintiff swore the affidavit in support of the current application. It was sworn by the advocate for 5th Plaintiff!",
            "27. It is also noted that, the counsel for these other Plaintiffs did not consent to the prayers sought in the current application. Indeed, the lack of consensus amongst the Plaintiffs is what apparently led to the failure to comply with the consent of 28.1.2021. It is quite apparent that the current application has been brought forth so that the Applicants may join this suit in their own terms by getting rid of the other Plaintiffs.",
            "28.  I also find that the application has not been filed timeously. The suit No. 5/2010 was filed more than 10 years ago. At what point in the lifespan of this suit did it dawn upon the Applicants that the suit was filed in the personal capacity of the Plaintiffs. I find that the amendment is being sought rather late in the day. One of the cardinal principles in our constitution is “the expeditious delivery of justice” –see Article 159 (2) (b) of the Constitution of Kenya, which in effect codifies the 17th century maxim of “Justice delayed is justice denied”. This means that if justice is not provided in a timely manner to the parties, it loses its importance and it violates the human rights of the litigants and their family.  That is precisely why rights to speedy trials are incorporated in law worldwide. Thus in law and in Equity, delayed justice is abhorred. It would be the hallmark of injustice if this court was to allow the removal of some Plaintiffs without their consent when they having been waiting in the corridors of justice for the last ten years.",
            "29.  Another notable point is the lack of good faith on the side of the Applicants. When it became apparent to the court that there was no consensus amongst the Plaintiffs and the consent of 28.1.2021 was set aside, the court promptly fixed the matter for hearing on 26.7. 2021. The current application was filed just a week to the date of hearing which is a mark of bad faith. The application had the effect of scuttling the hearing scheduled on 27.7.2021 and on 27.10.2021. It is not lost to this court that the court had already put the Plaintiffs on notice as they had been given last adjournments on 23.9.2020; while the 5th Plaintiff was specifically granted a last adjournment on 26.7.2021.",
            "30. The court has also taken into account that the proposed amendment has the effect of shifting goal posts since the Applicants want to introduce a new feature of the claim, that of a representative suit 10 years down the line. It has been stated that amendment of pleadings should only be allowed if it does not alter the cause of the suit. This was cited by the Court of Appeal in Catherine Koriko & 3 others v Evaline Rosa [2020] eKLR  making reference to Abdul Karim Khan –v- Mohamed Roshan (1965) EA.289 that ;",
            "“ …the courts will not permit an amendment that is inconsistent with original pleading and which entirely alters the nature of the defence or plaint…” .",
            "31.  It is also not lost to this court that Moses Kamuri (a proposed Plaintiff) is the 5th Defendant while Stephen Kamau is the 11th Defendant in the other suit 128/2020 where they have not only filed a defence, but they have a counterclaim. Thus the proposed Plaintiffs already have another platform of ventilating their claim.",
            "32. Another point of consideration is that the lifespan of the suit ELC 5 of 2010 has been anchored on nothing but applications for the last 10 years. Litigation has to come to an end one way or the other.  In the case of Lawrence Kinyua Mwai vs. Nyariginu Farmers CO. Ltd & Another (2019)eKLR, I stated thus;",
            " “ The circumstances of this case where the dispute has been in the legal arena for decades demand that this court imposes Active Case Management in order to achieve the overriding Objective set out under section 1A and 1B of the Civil Procedure Act even if it appears to be rather late in the day to do so, in order to have a closure in this file. Active Case Management is one of the best practices to combat case backlog and it is anchored on the courts ability to exercise Judicial control over the legal processes with a view to ensuring that the overriding objective is achieved.”",
            "33. Similarly, this court will apply Active Case Management to ensure that the matter is steered away from the stormy vast ocean of endless applications and preliminary objections so as to dock and tie up at a wharf of conclusion. Simply put, this court will not entertain applications which will hamper the main hearing anymore.",
            "34.  The disposal orders are that; The Notice of Motion application dated 19th July 2021 seeking leave to amend the pleadings is disallowed with costs to the Defendant. ",

            "1. The appellant faults the order striking out the suit for lack of jurisdiction claiming it was made in misapprehension of the facts and law obtaining in the matter.",
            "2. This being a first appeal the court is mandated to relook at the entire record, come up with its own findings on law and facts and establish if the decision made was properly grounded in law.",
            "3. The appellant had vide consent dated 24.12.2012 issued by the District Land Adjudication Officer sued the respondents to restrain them from entering and destroying vegetation and trees on his Parcel No. 3625 & 142 Antuamburi Adjudication Section.",
            "4. The respondents denied the claim that Parcel No. 417 was unfairly, wrongly and unlawfully subdivided. They denied any occupation by the appellant.  On the contrary, they alleged they had lawfully bought and got transferred their portions in 1986 and 1991 respectively after which they took vacant possession, and embarked on various developments.",
            "5. The court made a scene visit and a report was filed confirming destruction of trees.  Vide a ruling made on 1.11.2018, the trial court struck out the suit on the basis the appellant had not exhausted internal remedies under Sections 25 and 26(3) of the Land Consolidation Act Cap 183 Laws of Kenya leading to the instant appeal.",
            "6. The appellant submits the court has power to entertain  suits as held in William Onginjo Kenga –vs- Eric Mawira [2000] eKLR, Peter Ndirangu Muchemi –vs- Asiemo Ndatho Marenge [2018] eKLR, Nicholas Tukei –vs-Chepochepkatug Loyeruk & 2 Others eKLR.",
            "7. Further the appellant submits it is not mandatory to appeal to the Minister as held in Julius Ntuiti –vs- Mwirichia Kaumbuthu [2014] eKLR.  Additionally the appellant submits striking out a suit was drastic and must be rarely done as held in Omar Saleh Said –vs- Kilindini Warehouses (K) Ltd & Another [2013] eKLR and that it was not fair to condemn him unheard as held in Harrison Wanjohi Wambugu –vs- Felista Wairimu Chege & Another [2013] eKLR ",

On the part of the respondent, they submit the basis of the claim was objections No’s A/R 3654 & 3654 over Parcels No’s 3625 & 142, where the appellant was the objector while the respondents were the respondents, were heard and dismissed by Land Adjudication Officer as per Section 26 of Land Consolidation Act.",

            "12. The respondents at paragraph 5, 11 and 12 of the defence denied the illegality and claimed to have lawfully purchased the suit lands from M’Mungania M’Ekindu and Ntarangwi Bruno respectively. ",
            "13. Section 26 of Land Consolidation Act provides any person named or affected by the adjudication register, and who considers the register to be incomplete or inaccurate in any respect or aggrieved by the allocation of land as entered therein to appeal to the Minister within 60 days, after the notice in Section 25 of the Act is published.",
            "14. Now the questions which need to be answered are: whether the section ousts the jurisdiction of the court to superintend any illegalities and irregularities during the adjudication.  Put another way, other than the instances which are indicated in the Land Consolidation Act, did the legislature intend the role of the courts to be cosmetic and minimal to the extent that the role of the adjudication officer is left unsupervised?  More importantly to this case, what if the notice was not published and the appellant noticed the actions of the respondents knowing very well the Minister and or the adjudication officer had no powers, unlike courts to issue restraining orders.  Can it therefore be said the consent order issued by the land adjudication officer had no basis in law?",
            "15. Additionally, what should the courts make of parties issued with consent to sue for a specific order but widen their scope and seek prayers beyond what was initially indicated in the consent.",
            "16. In Tobias Achoka Osindi & 13 Others –vs- Cyprian Otieno Ogola & 6 Others [2013] eKLR the court held that the power and authority of ascertainment and determination of rights and interests belong to the land adjudication officer with the court’s role being supervisory in nature.",
            "17. Given the facts in this matter, the trial court appears to have taken a narrower view of the issues raised in the pleadings.",
            "18. It follows therefore the court cannot take up the powers to ascertain and determine rights and interests over land within an adjudication area.  That does not mean the court cannot determine any complaints against an adjudication officer who has acted outside the law.",
            "19. In my considered view Parliament gave adjudication officers powers to issue consent since it was expected there would be instances where the courts’ intervention would be inevitable.",
            "20. It could not have been the intention of the legislature to deny parties with deserving and urgent complains from enjoying their Constitutional rights as to fair hearing and access to justice.",
            "21. One of the ways in which the access to justice has been widened on land disputes is the enactment of the Environment and Land Court and the amendment to the Magistrates Courts Act.",
            "22. The Land Adjudication Act and the Land Consolidation Act must be read together with the Constitution of Kenya 2010 and all other laws thereof in line with the National Land Policy 2016.  Similarly Kenyans have a right to fair administrative action especially those exercising quasi-judicial powers such as the land adjudication officers, land adjudication committee, board and the Minister.  They cannot therefore operate in a manner which is not in pare meteria with the above laws.",
            "23. In the same way, parties who act or cause the process of adjudication to be done below what is expected by the law cannot come to court and object to the role of the court in the name of lack of jurisdiction. ",
            "24. In Stephen Kungutia & 2 Others –vs- Severina Nchulubi Nyeri Civil Appeal No. 221 of 2020, the court was emphatic on this point.                                                           ",
            "25. I therefore find the appeal herein with merits.  The same is allowed with costs to the appellant.",

            "(An appeal arising from the original sentence in Criminal Case No. 869 of 2019 ",
            "in the Principal Magistrate’s Court – Webuye Law Courts ",
            "by Hon. M. Munyekenye (RM) on 30/12/2019)",
            "JUDGMENT",
            "1. The Appellant Kevin Spencer was charged and convicted on his own plea of guilty in two counts. He had been charged with the offence of causing death by dangerous driving contrary to section 46 of the Traffic Act Cap 403 Laws of Kenya in count I and the offence of riding a motorcycle on a public road without a driving license, contrary to section 103(B)(5) as read with section 103(B)(7) of the Traffic Act CAP 403 Laws of Kenya in count II. He was consequently sentenced to serve seven (7) years’ imprisonment in count I and six months’ imprisonment in count II. The jail terms were to run concurrently.",
            "2. Being aggrieved, the Appellant filed the instant appeal which is against sentence only. In his mitigation he states that he is remorseful and seeks the court to allow him serve the remainder of his sentence on probation. Further that he is a first offender and the sole bread winner of his family, particularly his younger siblings, since their mother has since died.",
            "3. The Respondent filed written submissions through learned Principal Prosecution Counsel Mr. Ahindukha, who conceded the appeal on sentence stating that the State had no objection to the Court relooking at the severity of the sentence imposed on the Appellant. He stated that the Appellant had shown remorse, and that by pleading guilty to the offence, he had saved the court’s time.",
            "4. The court is therefore being called up to examine whether the sentence imposed upon the Appellant was harsh in the circumstances, to warrant interference with the discretion of the Trial court on sentencing. I am alive to the fact that sentencing is essentially an exercise of discretion by the trial court, and that an appellate court will only interfere with the sentence if it is demonstrated that in passing the sentence, the trial court acted upon wrong principles, overlooked some material factors, or the sentence itself is manifestly excessive in view of the circumstances of the case. (See – Ogolla s/o Owuor vs. Republic [1954] EACA 270 and Patrick Muli Mukutha vs. Republic [2019] eKLR).",
            "5. In count I, the Appellant was charged under section 46 of the Traffic Act which provides that upon conviction, one is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten (10) years. In the instant case, the Appellant was sentenced to seven (7) years’ imprisonment.",
            "6. Whereas a custodial sentence can be deemed appropriate in the circumstances considering that a life was lost, the seven (7) years’ imprisonment term may be said to be excessive in view of the fact that the Appellant was remorseful, a first time offender and pleaded guilty to the offence thereby saving the court’s time. These factors qualify as mitigating factors under clause 23.8 of the Sentencing Policy Guidelines and have an impact on the custodial sentence imposed as stipulated under clause 23.9 of the Guidelines.",
            "7. In respect of count II, I note that under section 103(B)(5) as read with section 103(B)(7) of the Traffic Act under which the Appellant was charged, upon conviction one is liable to a fine not exceeding ten thousand shillings or, in default of payment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve (12) months. In the instant case, the trial court only imposed an imprisonment term without the option of a fine, in disregard of the provisions of the sections under which the Appellant was charged.",
            "8. The upshot of the foregoing is that the appeal is found to be meritorious and is hereby allowed. I hereby set aside the sentence imposed by the trial court in both counts and substitute therefor; in count I, a sentence of four (4) years’ imprisonment and in count II, a fine of Kshs. 10,000/= and in default, imprisonment for three (3) months.",
            "The sentence in count I shall run concurrently with the default sentence in count II should the Appellant be unable to pay the fine.",
            "It is so ordered.",

            "JUDGMENT",
            "Introduction",
            "1. The Claimant filed this suit by way of a Memorandum of Claim dated 18th February, 2016 and filed in court on the same date through the Firm of G.N. Gichong’i Gichuhi & Co. Advocates.",
            "2. The Claimant further filed an Amended Memorandum of Claim on the 28th of June, 2016, wherein, the Respondent was substituted with Registered Trustees of Kiambu Institute of Science and Technology.",
            "3. The Claimant contends that she was in the service of the Respondent between the years 1983 to 2014.",
            "4. The Claimant’s further contention is that the Respondent owes her house allowances amounting to Kshs. 330,000 for the year 1983 to 2011, salary underpayment of Kshs. 965,238, severance pay of Kshs. 130,423 and long service award of Kshs. 150,000.",
            "5. The Respondent filed a response to the Claimant’s claim on the 7th of June, 2016, wherein, it strongly denies the claim and further avers that the claim is time barred by the Statute of limitations and other relevant laws of the land.",
            "6. Both parties filed submission in the matter.",
            "The Claimant’s Case ",
            "7. The Claimant’s case is that she was an employee of the Respondent between the year 1983 to 2014, when she retired through normal retirement",
            "8. It is her case that despite serving the Respondent with dedication and devotion for 31 years, the Respondent deliberately refused to pay her terminal benefits.",
            "9. The Claimant’s prayer is that judgment be entered in her favour and against the Respondent as follows:",
            "i. That the court do find the Respondent’s action of continued withholding, failing, refusal and/or neglecting to compute and disburse the rightful terminal benefits, unpaid dues and underpayment is unlawful and untenable.",
            "ii. That the Respondent has been in breach of the Employment Act and other relevant Labour laws",
            "iii. That as a result the court do order that the Respondent pay the Claimant all her terminal benefits and other unpaid dues computed as hereunder:",
            "A. House Allowance",
            "Years 1983-2006 at Kshs. 1000 per month (Kshs. 1000 X 12X23 years) = 276,000",
            "Year 2009 to 2011 at Kshs. 1,500 ( Kshs. 1500X12X3 years)= 54,000",

            "The Respondent’s case ",
            "10. The Respondent denies being the employer of the Claimant and further avers that the suit is bad in law for reason that it does not have capacity to be sued and especially by the Claimant who has never been its employee.",
            "11. The Respondent further case, is that the Claimant was paid all her dues including retirement benefits, salaries and that no dues are owed to her by the Respondent.",
            "12. It is the Respondent’s contention that the Claimants claim is time barred by the Statute of limitation.",
            "13. The Claimant testified in support of her case during trial and the Respondent called one Ms. Ruth Wambui Kamau, a Finance officer of the Respondent to testify on its behalf.",
            "Submissions ",
            "The Claimant’s Submission",
            "14. It is submitted for the Claimant that the Respondent’s continued withholding the Claimant’s retirement benefits is illegal, unlawful, and a breach of her contract which entitles her to damages, as she has suffered financial embarrassment, inconvenience and has led a less satisfying life since her retirement. She sought to rely on the holding in the case of Chrisantus Onyain v Standard Chartered Bank (2011) eKLR",
            "15. It is submitted that the Claimant is entitled to the remedies sought as the dues were never paid during her employment with the Respondent.",
            "16. It is further submitted that the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Claimant’s Union and the Respondent, had clearly provided for payment of house severance pay, yet the same was never paid.",
            "The Respondent’s Submissions",
            "17. It is submitted for the Respondent, that the Respondent has a staff pension contributory scheme, where the Claimant contributed to and was paid both her contribution and the employer’s contribution upon her retirement. It is further submitted that the Claimant retired through the normal retirement process upon attaining the age of 60 years.",
            "18. It is submitted that the Claimant’s salary was guided by the CBA and for this reason there was no underpayment.",
            "19. The Respondent submitted that it was never the Claimant’s employer and that she has sued a wrong Respondent and the suit should be dismissed.",
            "20.  It is submitted that the claims for house allowance, severance pay and underpayment lacks merit and should be dismissed. It is further submitted that the suit is time barred for having been filed outside the 3 years statutory period per Section 90 of the Employment Act. They sought to rely on the case of G4S Security Services (k) Limited v Joseph Kamau & 468 others.",
            "The Issues",
            "21. The court identified the following issues for determination:",
            "i. Whether the Claimant was an employee of the Respondent",
            "ii. Whether the Claimant is deserving of the reliefs sought",
            "Whether the Claimant was an employee of the Respondent",
            "22. The Claimant’s claim filed before court on the 18th of February, 2016, listed Kiambu Institute of Science and Technology as the Respondent.",
            "23. The claim was later amended in June, 2016, wherein, the Registered Trustees of Kiambu Institute of Science and Technology was brought in as the Respondent in place of the earlier Respondent; Kiambu Institute of Science and Technology.",
            "24. The Claimant’s testimony was that she was employed by Riara Coffee Farm, but which she claimed to be one and the same as Kiambu Institute of Science and technology as well as the Registered Trustee of Kiambu Institute of Science and technology.",
            "25. The Respondent’s witness in her testimony clarified to the court that the Registered Trustees of Kiambu Institute of Science and Technology owned both the Institute and Riara Coffee farm where the Claimant was employed and is indeed the umbrella Institution for the two sub-entities.",
            "26. It is her further testimony that the Registered Trustees, being the owners of Riara Coffee Farm, wrote to the Claimant to notify her of her impending retirement. This is confirmed by the letter of retirement notice dated 18th August, 2014 and which was produced in evidence before court.",
            "27.  In a further letter dated 8th December, 2015, produced as evidence in court by the Respondent’s witness, the Registered Trustees of the Kiambu Institute of Science and Technology Provident Fund were informed of the Claimant’s retirement by the Registered Trustees of Kiambu Institute of Science and Technology, and which letter was signed off by one Aloysius Mungai Muhia, the Chairman of Kiambu Institute of Science and Technology -Board of Trustees of Riara Farm management committee. This letter stated that the Claimant herein was an employee of Kiambu Institute of Science and Technology-Board of Trustees, Riara Farm Unit.",
            "28. Contrary to the Respondent’s assertion, their evidence before this court is proof that Kiambu Institute of Science and Technology and Riara Coffee Farm are both entities owned by the Registered Trustee of Kiambu Institute of Science and Technology and the employer of the Claimant.",
            "29. The Claimant having amended her claim to have the Respondent as the Registered Trustees of Kiambu Institute of Science and Technology, indeed sued the right party and the court finds and holds that Claimant was an employee of the Respondent.",
            "Whether the Claimant is deserving of the reliefs sought",
            "30. The Claimant’s claim is for payment of House allowances, Salary underpayment, Severance pay and long service award. I will deal with each of the reliefs sought separately.",
            "House Allowance",
            "31. The Claimant in her testimony states that during her employment with the Respondent, she was not paid a house allowance until the year 2012, when the same was included in her pay slip.",
            "32. It is her case that from 1983 to 2011, she was never paid a house allowance and her claim is for the house allowance covering this period.",
            "33. The Claimant admitted during cross examination that the Respondent had given her a house at its servant quarters, but which she moved out of after one year, when she was asked to share the house with another employee of the Respondent.",
            "34. The Respondent position is that the Claimant never raised any issues to do with payment of house allowance, until the time she received her notice of retirement.",
            "35. The Respondent further states that the Claimant vacated the house allocated to her by the Respondent in the year 2012, and that the Respondent paid her a house allowance since then up to the time of her retirement.",
            "36.  It is the Respondent’s case that it does not owe the Claimant’s any money and further that the Claimant’s claim is statutory time barred.",
            "37. The claim for house allowance relates to the years 1983 to 2011. The Respondent in their response to claim state that this claim is statutory time barred. Section 90 of the Employment Act 2007 provides as follows;",
            "“Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4(1) of the Limitation of Actions Act (Cap. 22), no civil action or proceedings based or arising out of this Act or a contract of service in general shall lie or be instituted unless it is commenced within three years next after the act, neglect or default complained or in the case of continuing injury or damage within twelve months next after the cessation thereof.”",
            "38. From the foregoing provisions of Section 90 of the Employment Act, 2007, the Act contemplates two classes of causes of action. First being the one-time injury where the cause of action expires after 3 years and the second is a continuing injury, where the cause of action expires 12 months’ next after the cessation  of the  injury.",
            "39. The Claimant’s case is that she did not live in the employer’s allocated house from 1983 to 2011 and that she was only paid a house allowance from the year 2012 to 2014 when she retired. Even if the court were to find justifiable reasons for the Claimant’s refusal to stay in the house allocated to her by the Respondent, the cause of action accrued between the year 1983 to 2011. The suit herein was filed in February, 2016, which is between 5 to 33 years after each cause of action accrued.",
            "40.  In so far as this claim relates to causes of action that accrued between 1983 and 2011, this claim is time barred under the provisions of Section 90 of the Employment Act of 2007. The Court therefore lacks jurisdiction to entertain this claim and the same fails and is dismissed. This was the holding of the court of appeal in the case of G4S Security Services (K) Limited v Joseph Kamau & 468 others [2018] eKLR and which was further fortified by the same court in the case of Attorney General & another v Andrew Maina Githinji and another [2016] eKLR where in upholding a Preliminary Objection based on Section 90 of the Employment Act, Waki JA held as follows:",
            "“…The Respondents had a clear cause of action against the employer when they received their letters of dismissal on 2nd October 2010. They had all the facts which had been placed before them in the disciplinary proceedings and they could have filed legal proceedings if they felt aggrieved by that dismissal, but they did not. Having found that the cause of action arose on 2nd February 2010 and that the claim was filed on 16th June 2014, it follows by simple arithmetic that the limitation period of 3 years was surpassed by a long margin. The claim was time barred as at 1st February 2013.”",
            "Salary underpayment",
            "41. The Claimant claims salary underpayment for the 31 years she was in the service of the Respondent.",
            "42. Part of this claim is time barred for similar reasons as expressed above. The question then becomes whether the Claimant was underpaid in the time between from February, 2014 to December, 2014 when she retired, being the only period that falls within the purview of Section 90 of the employment Act, 2007. ",
            "43. The Claimant admits being a member of a union and the Respondent states that the salaries paid to the Claimant throughout her time with the Respondent, is that which was agreed upon between the union and the employer (Respondent).",
            "44. The Claimant did not show that she was indeed underpaid compared to other employees in her cadre or that her pay was below that which was agreed upon by her Union and the Respondent. The Claimant was under obligation to prove her claim, which she did not. In the circumstances this claim fails and is dismissed.",
            "Severance Pay",
            "45. The Claimant herein left service through normal retirement on attaining the legal age of retirement.  Further, she was a member of a Provident Fund where she and the Respondent contributed into. The evidence before court indicate that she was paid both her pension contribution and the employer’s upon retirement. This claim is without merit and is hereby dismissed.",
            "Long Service Award",
            "46. No evidence has been proffered to show that the Respondent had made a promise of such an award, either through contract or Collective Bargaining agreement with the Claimant or her Union. This claim equally lacks merit and is dismissed.",
            "47. In conclusion, this suit is dismissed in its entirety.",
            "48. Considering the age of the Claimant and the fact that she is currently unemployed, I will make no orders as to costs.",
            "49. It is so ordered.",

            "1. In a judgment delivered on 16 September 2019, the Court awarded Dennish Owino Omega (the Claimant) the equivalent of 5-months’ salary as compensation for unfair termination of employment together with costs and interest.",
            "2. The Claimant moved to execute, and on 24 March 2021, the KCB Bank Kenya Ltd (the Objector) filed a Motion seeking orders:",
            "(1) …",
            "(2) …",
            "(3)  This Honourable Court be pleased to set aside the warrants of attachment and sale issued herein, and as a consequence, an order be issued unconditionally lifting/raising the attachment of all the assets proclaimed.",
            "(4)  That this Honourable Court be pleased to issue an order of stay of execution of the judgment entered on the 16th of September, 2019 and the decree issued on 9th March 2021 and all its subsequent and ancillary proceedings (save for this application).",
            "(5)  This Honourable Court be pleased to make any other orders as it deems fit in the circumstances.",
            "(6)  Costs of this application be provided for.",
            "3. The Claimant filed a replying affidavit in opposition to the Motion on 31 May 2021.",
            "4. None of the parties filed submissions within the agreed timelines as directed.",
            "5. The principal ground advanced by the Objector in support of the Motion to set aside the warrants/stay of execution were that it was the holder of various floating and fixed debentures over the assets of the Respondent and that it had appointed a Receiver Manager on 20 September 2019 over the assets.",
            "6. Consequently, the Objector asserted that it had a legal and equitable interest in the proclaimed assets and which interest ranked higher in priority to that of the Claimant.",
            "7. The Objector further contended that there were pending insolvency proceedings against the Respondent in Nairobi Insolvency Petition No. E004 of 2019, Kimeto & Associates Advocates v KCB Bank Kenya Ltd & Ors and Nairobi Insolvency Petition No. E007 of 2019, by Kimeto & Associates Advocates, and therefore the execution was ex facie defective and void ab initio.",

            "If a company is being liquidated by the Court, any attachment, sequestration, distress or execution instigated against the assets of the company after the commencement of the liquidation is void.",
            "9. In opposition to the Motion, the Claimant deposed that his interests ranked higher than that of the Objector as a floating debenture holder and that the appointment of a Receiver did not automatically crystallise a charge and, therefore, the execution was valid.",
            "10. The Claimant relied on Boleyn Magic Wall Panel Ltd v Nesco Services Ltd; Boleyn International (K) Ltd (Objector) (2021) eKLR, and James Job Kihori Kahagi v Kencity Clothing Ltd (1977) eKLR.",
            "11. The Court has considered the material placed before it by the parties.",
            "12. It is not in dispute that the Objector appointed a Receiver of the Respondent on 20 September 2019 before the Claimant moved to execute (the case of Kencity Clothing addressed execution before the appointment of a Receiver).",
            "13. It is also not in dispute that there were at least 2 Insolvency Petitions against the Respondent before the High Court in Nairobi.",
            "14. By dint of section 431(3) of the Insolvency Act, it is deemed that the liquidation of the Respondent commenced when the liquidation applications were made to the High Court in 2019.",
            "15. Consequently, pursuant to section 430 of the Insolvency Act, the execution by the Claimant was rendered void.",
            "16. Despite reaching the conclusion, it is regrettable that none of the parties deemed it appropriate to disclose the current status of the 2 Insolvency Petitions before the High Court.",
            "17. The Court also notes that the Claimant moved to execute over 1-year after judgment, thus probably implicating the provisions of Order 22 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules.",

            "JUDGMENT",
            "1. The Claimant instituted the suit vide a Memorandum of Claim dated 9th September 2016 against the Respondent for the unfair termination of his employment. He avers that in October 2014, the Respondent employed him as a Truck Driver within the operations department by a contract of employment and that he received a letter of confirmation of employment dated 17th April 2015. The Claimant averred that his monthly salary was Kshs. 47,000/- and that he diligently performed his duties throughout his employment with the Respondent.  The Claimant avers that by a letter dated 24th February 2016 the Respondent by its directors, supervisors and/or agents unlawfully terminated his employment without a valid and fair reason and because of his continued illness and that the Respondent has also refused and/or neglected to pay him his lawful dues. He thus seeks 3 months’ salary in lieu of notice, service pay for 1 year at 15 days for each year worked, 12 months’ salary as compensation for unlawful termination and full salary payment from December to April 2016. The Claimant prays to judgment against the Respondent for: the sum of Kenya Shillings Nine Hundred Forty Nine Thousand One Hundred and Fifteen only (Kshs. 949,115/-); interest and costs incidental to this suit; Certificate of Service; and any such other or further relief as this Honourable court may deem fit and just go to grant.",
            "2. In his written Statement, the Claimant asserts that on 22nd September 2015 at around 4.00pm, he was undertaking his duties at the Respondent’s place of work in Turkana and while loading the truck he stretched his spine and developed numbness in the lower limb. That he underwent treatment at a clinic but on 24th September 2015 his condition worsened and he was airlifted to Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi where he was treated and admitted by Dr. Olunya Oluoch and that he was thereafter operated on and later discharged on 7th October 2015. He further states that he received a letter dated 24th February 2016 from the Respondent indicating that his employment term had expired on 13th January 2016 but which position was not true as his employment had been confirmed for a period of 12 months by a letter dated 17th April 2015. He also asserts that at the time of termination of employment, the Respondent did not offer him three months' salary in lieu of notice as per the terms of the contract and neither did it pay him his full salary from December 2015 to April 2016 when his contract was expected to expire. He states that in support of his claim he has annexed copies of his contract of employment, confirmation of employment, termination letter, demand letter and payslips.",
            "3. The Respondent was opposed to the claim and filed an Answer to Claim dated 13th December 2016 denying to have confirmed the Claimant’s employment with a monthly salary of Kshs. 47,000/- or that it unfairly terminated his employment. It avers that prior to the Claimant's termination it accorded to him all the privileges owing to an ailing employee as under the Employment Act and the contract of employment between them in addition to catering for his medical expenses. The Respondent avers that the Claimant is not deserving of the amounts pleaded in his Claim and that it further owes no outstanding amount to him. The Respondent prays that the Claimant’s Claim be dismissed with costs. The Respondent also filed a witness statement made on 15th November 2018 by a Senior Associate in its Human Resource Department, Japheth Mushira who states that when the Claimant was employed by the Respondent on 13th October 2014, the terms of his employment were that he was on three (3) months' probation and a one (1) year contract thereafter. It avers that following the Claimant’s hospitalization and treatment, the Respondent accepted his sick leave as advised by the hospital upon production of the relevant medical certificates showing he was to be on sick leave up to 29th January 2016. That the Claimant was subsequently paid sick leave by the Respondent as follows: Full pay for 30 days sick leave from 7th October 2015 to 6th November 2015; Half pay for the months of November and December 2015. The Respondent avers that the above said provisions for sick leave were above the provisions of Section 30 of the Employment Act requiring payment on sick leave to be seven days on full pay and seven days on half pay. The Respondent avers that it acknowledges that the Claimant is entitled to compensation under the Work Injury Benefits Act for the injuries he sustained and even took up the matter with their insurer First Assurance/AON and that there is an ongoing suit on the matter being Milimani Civil Suit No. 5421 of 2006. It avers that the dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent arose when the Respondent made a decision to take the Claimant off sick pay and which have culminated in the instant suit. It is his statement that the Claimant was not unlawfully or unfairly terminated but that his contract of employment with the Respondent was for a defined period of time and which thus terminated as a result of effluxion of time.",
            "4. The Claimant testified as did the Respondent’s witness Japheth Shijenje Mushira who was the Respondent’s Kenya HR Associate at the material time. The Claimant testified that his probation was for 3 months but he did not receive the letter of confirmation until 3 months after the end of his probation period meaning it took 6 months for the Respondent to confirm him to employment. He stated that the injury occurred while he was working for the Respondent and he was airlifted to Aga Khan Hospital and his medical expenses covered by the Respondent. He testified that the Respondent then terminated his services without following the law on account of his condition. The Respondent’s witness on his part testified that the Respondent employed the Claimant on 13th October 2014 as a truck driver and confirmed him into employment for a one year contract. He stated that the Claimant suffered an injury while in the oilfield where Tullow Oil was prospecting for oil and he was airlifted to Nairobi for treatment at Aga Khan Hospital and that the Respondent covered his medical bills through his medical cover. He stated that the Claimant’s contract provided for 30 days sick leave, 14 days thereafter on half pay and that the Claimant was given sick off commensurate with his contract. He stated that the disability was assessed and was 48% meaning the Claimant could no longer work for the Respondent. He testified that the contract the Claimant had expired on 13th January 2016 which is when the relationship between the company and the employee was severed.",
            "5. Claimant’s Submissions",
            "The Claimant submits that pursuant to clause 3.4 of the employment contract, the Claimant was confirmed on 17th April 2015 and there was legitimate expectation that the contract would expire on 17th April 2016. He submits that however, the period between confirmation and termination of the contract is nine months and the Respondent’s witness also confirmed in cross examination that the Claimant’s termination was done before the end of one year as stipulated in the contract. The Claimant submits that it is therefore safe to conclude that he was terminated prematurely as a result of his medical condition. He submits that in the case of Walter Ogal Anuro v Teachers Service Commission [2013] eKLR the Court held that: “.... For a termination of employment to pass the fairness test, there must be both substantive justification and procedural fairness. Substantive justification has to do with establishment of a valid reason for the termination while procedural fairness addresses the procedure adopted by the employer to effect the termination.” The Claimant submits that Section 45(2)(c) of the Employment Act, 2007 subjects all terminations to the test of a fair procedure while Section 41 provides the procedure to be followed when terminating the services of an employee on the grounds of misconduct, poor performance or physical incapacity. The Claimant submits that however the Respondent did not follow the said due procedure and the termination of his employment was unlawful as his incapacity was not put to test. The Claimant further submits that the Respondent did not address the question of the substantive fairness of his termination and only opined that the contract had lapsed. He submits that Section 35(1)(c) of the Employment Act provides for notice or payment in lieu of notice and clause 13 of the contract of employment provided for termination through giving two months’ notice or two months’ pay in lieu of notice but which term the Respondent did not comply with. It is submitted by the Claimant that as a consequence of the breach of contract he is entitled to two month’s pay in lieu of notice in the sum of Kshs. 94,000/- and twelve months’ pay compensation for damages and loss of employment in the sum of Kshs. 564,000/-. That he did testify not receiving salary for the months of December 2015 to April 2016 being a period of five months when the employment contract was still active. The Claimant submits that the Respondent did not controvert this evidence considering it is the custodian of all employment records including payment of salary pursuant to Section 10(2)(h) and (i) and only produced the December 2015 payslip which does not prove any payments to him. The Claimant relies on the case of Joseph Ouko Lwambe v Royal Garment Industries EPZ Limited [2018] eKLR where the Court while awarding unpaid salary observed as follows:",
            "“The question then follows is the payslip conclusive evidence of payment of salary? In my view the answer is NO. The Payslip is a document prepared by the Respondent Company indicating the amount payable as salary for work done on a given period. There is no evidence as to whether the Claimant received the salary and the fact that there is a payslip for October, 2013 builds a lot of doubt as to whether the same is a true reflection of what transpired. I opine that the Claimant’s claim for unpaid salary be allowed in the circumstances.”",
            "6. No submissions were filed by the Respondent and this decision is rendered on the basis of the pleadings filed, the testimony adduced and the submissions as well as the law. In the case, the Claimant was injured and was subsequently let go on 13th January 2016. The reason given for the termination was the injury suffered by the Claimant. Under the provisions of Section 41, the Claimant was entitled to some degree of safeguard. He should have been notified of the intention to terminate his services on account of incapacity. His contract ran from 13th October 2014 and he was apparently given a letter of confirmation 6 months after his employ. He then served the full one year under the contract. His contract would have lapsed on 13th October 2015 but he continued to serve till 13th January 2016 when he was let go ostensibly as the confirmation of the contract in January 2015 meant in the mind of the Respondent that his contract ran from then till January 2016. This was incorrect as the actual expiry of contract was in October 2015 and he was deemed to have received a renewal of contract to October 2016. The premature termination of his second contract was without due regard to Section 41 as he should have been notified that the employer intended to terminate the contract as he was incapacitated. This would entitle the Claimant to some recompense by way of 3 months salary as compensation. In relation to the injury it is indicated that there is a suit pending where he is pressing the claim for compensation for the injury and the Court will say no more.",
            "7. In the final analysis, I find and hold that the termination of the contract on 13th January 2016 was unfair and unlawful as the Respondent did not afford the Claimant a hearing in terms of Section 41 for which I enter judgment against the Respondent for:",

            "1. Before the court is an application dated 26.8.2021 seeking for stay of execution pending hearing and determination of the appeal.  The same is supported by an affidavit sworn on 26.8.2021 by Mary Kingori.",
            "2. The grounds in support of the application are that an appeal has been made against the judgment rendered on 10.2.2020; the proceedings are yet to be supplied; the appeal has high chances of success; if stay is not granted, the substratum of the appeal shall be lost; the applicant is willing to offer security; there has been no inordinate delay; that the respondent is unlikely to be prejudiced; the execution is imminent; the respondent is not able to refund the amount should the appeal succeed.",
            "3.  The plaintiff has opposed the application through grounds of opposition dated 22.9.2021.",
            "4. In her submissions, the applicant urges the court to find she has met the conditions under Order 42 rule 6.  On substantial loss, she claims her assets have been attached and sold and the appeal will remain an academic exercise.",
            "5. Secondly it is submitted the respondent has not specified the prejudice he will suffer.",
            "6. Thirdly it is submitted the notice of appeal has been filed, proceedings have been sought though there has been delay on the part of the court in availing them.",
            "7. Fourthly, it is submitted the respondent is not in a position to refund the sum and should not be entrusted with such a sum. He has not stated his financial standing and hence capacity to refund.",
            "8. Reliance is made on Kenya Orient Insurance Co. Ltd –vs- Paul Mathenge Gichuki & Another [2014] eKLR  on the proposition that the burden to proof financial capacity to refund shifts to the respondent once raised by an applicant while the legal burden remains on the applicant.  This may include cash in bank and land.",
            "9. Regarding security, the applicant submits her willingness to offer security through an interest earning account.  Reliance is based on M.A. Koinange –vs- Joyce Gachuku & 2 Others [2015] eKLR, Jared Kiprotich Biwott and Another –vs- Jonathan Kibe [2020] eKLR.",
            "10. Order 42 rule 6 of Civil Procedure Rules provides for three parameters to be met by a party seeking stay of execution namely substantial loss, application is made without unreasonable delay and furnishing of sufficient security.  There is no dispute  judgment was rendered on 10.2.2020 subsequent to which a review order was made on 28.7.2021 as regards the liability of 2nd and 3rd defendants to pay costs. The applicant did not apply for stay until warrants of attachment were issued against her.",
            "11. My finding is that there was inordinate delay in applying for stay.  In any event the post judgment application was not on whether costs payable to the plaintiff were to be met by all the defendants.  There was therefore no need for the applicant to await until action was taken against her so as to apply for stay of execution.",
            "12. Concerning substantial loss, in Kenya Shell Limited –vs- Benjamin Karuga Kibiru & another [1986] eKLR 410 it was stated a party must substantiate this through empirical and documentary evidence.  It not enough for the applicant to assert the amount is substantial.  The amount is with regard to a deposit of purchase price which the applicant has kept with her for over 15 years.  There must be good reason given why the respondent who has been thrown out of the premises should be kept away from his deposit for another extra day.  The  applicant in the trial court admitted receiving the money which assisted her and her son to undertake some business and eventually pay off the loan.  It is within the court’s knowledge that even after selling the property to the 2nd and 3rd defendants the applicant did not offer any refund to the plaintiff.",
            "13. As regards the inability of the respondent to refund the sum in the event the appeal is successful, the applicant in her affidavit has raised some apprehension that the respondent may not be in a position to do so.  The said fear was raised on oath.  Unfortunately the respondent has not sworn an affidavit to counter that accusation and perhaps demonstrate his financial health.",
            "14. In National Industrial Credit Bank Ltd. –vs- Aquinas Francis Wasike & Another [2006] eKLR the Court of Appeal took the view that once reasonable fear is expressed by an applicant of the inability to refund, the evidential burden shifts to the respondent to demonstrate the resources he has as per Section 112 of the Evidence Act.  The respondent has not discharged that burden, by way of counter-evidence.",
            "15. As to the issue of security for the due performance of the decree in the event the appeal does not succeed, the applicant has offered security in terms of depositing the decretal amount in an interest earning account.",
            "16. Over and above the conditions set under Order 42 rule 6 the court must also look at the overriding objective set out in Sections 1A, 1B of the Civil Procedure Act and Article 159 of the Constitution.",
            "17. Though the application was filed late and the applicant has not demonstrated any substantial loss to suffer, it is my finding that in the interest of wider justice, the application has merits.  The same is allowed on the following terms:-",
            "a. Stay be and is hereby granted for a period of one year from the date hereof.",
            "b. Kshs. 2,000,000/= be deposited in interest earning account in a refutable bank in the joint names of the advocates for the plaintiff and the 1st defendant within 14 days from the date hereof.",
            "c. The applicant to deposit Kshs. 350,000/= with the plaintiff’s advocates as security for costs and costs for the auctioneer.",
            "d. In default of any single condition, the stay orders to stand vacated.",

        "judgement": [
            "JUDGMENT",
            "1. The Appellant, Anita Chepkemoi Langat was charged with the offence of Infanticide contrary to Section 210 of the Penal Code. The particulars are that on 25th day of January 2020 at Kurumana village in Chepalungu Sub-County within Bomet county, killed her baby namely DC, a child under the age of twelve (12) months by jumping with her in an open water pan.  She pleaded guilty to the charge. ",
            "2. The facts as presented by the prosecution were that on 26th January 2020 at 8:37 am the Chief Siongiroi location reported that the body of a small child had been seen floating in a dam within Siongiroi.  Police officers responded where they discovered the body of the child aged 12 months daughter of accused and Wilson Langat.  Upon enquiry it was suspected that the accused might have committed suicide with the child.  A search was done and the accused was found at the nearby village.  She admitted jumping into the water with the child.  The accused was arrested.  The body was taken to Longisa mortuary.  The immunization card was produced as P-exhibit 1.",
            "3. The Appellant confirmed the facts and was convicted on her own plea of guilty.  She was sentenced to serve seven years in prison.",
            "4. Being aggrieved by the decision of the lower court, the Appellant filed her Appeal dated 17th December 2020 expressing her dissatisfaction with the findings of the trial court.  In her home made petition which is titled “Mitigation of Appeal”, the Appellant set out the grounds reproduced verbatim as follows:-",
            "i.    THAT I am a first offender, the daughter of a single mother, the bread winner of our family and my one child.",
            "ii.   THAT I am 22 years old and the 7 year sentence will hinder my life because my family needs help.",
            "iii.  THAT when I came to prison, I was eight months pregnant and have delivered in prison and the baby is now 2½ months old and was now vulnerable especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "iv.  THAT the Honourable Court do quash the Conviction and treat the case as a family affair.",
            "5. The appeal came up for directions on 19th July 2021 and parties agreed to proceed by way of written submissions which the Appellant duly filed on 5th October 2021.   The Respondent did not file written submissions and submitted orally.",
            "6. This court’s duty is to evaluate and scrutinize evidence on record and draw its own independent conclusions. The Court of Appeal in the case of Mark Ouiruri Mose Vs. R (2013) eKLR, held that:-",
            "“This court has a duty to revisit the evidence tendered before the trial court afresh, evaluate it, analyse it and come to its own independent conclusion on the matter.”",
            "The Appellant’s submissions.",
            "7. The Appellant submitted that she was a 22 year old Kenyan who was married with three children, including one who was deceased. That on the material day, her husband started quarrelling her when she told him that she was pregnant. It was the Appellant’s further submission that the husband denied responsibility and told her that the pregnancy belonged to someone else. That at that point, he removed her from their house at his place of work in Naivasha and dispatched her back to his parent’s home.  That his parents tried to intervene but he remained adamant.",
            "8. It was the Appellant’s submission that the devil used her when she threw herself and her child into a water well. That she was confused and could not comprehend what had happened to her.",
            "9. The Appellant further submitted that she was imprisoned while pregnant and had given birth in prison. That at the time of the offence she was ignorant but that she was now rehabilitated, and had reformed and become a changed person.",
            "10.  She prayed that this court quash the conviction or give her a non-custodial sentence.",
            "Prosecution case",
            "11. The prosecution submitted that the Appellant had pleaded guilty and that her submission was only on mitigation. They further stated that the 7 year sentence was in accordance to the law and urged this court not to interfere with it.",
            "12. I have gone through and considered the trial court proceedings, the Appeal dated 17th December 2020, the Appellant’s written submission filed on 5th October 2021 and the Prosecution’s oral submissions.  The only issue for determination is whether the Sentence meted out against the Appellant was excessive.",
            "13. It was not in dispute that the Appellant was convicted on her own plea of guilt. It follows therefore that the Appellant cannot appeal her conviction. Section 348 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) provides that:-",
            "“No appeal shall be allowed in the case of an accused person who has pleaded guilty and has been convicted on that plea by a subordinate court, except as to the extent or legality of the sentence.”",
            "14. It is not enough however for a first appellant court to conclude that every conviction on guilty plea falls within Section 348 of the CPC.  The court must determine whether or not such plea was unequivocal as required by law.  I agree with the holding of Majanja J in the case of Balunye Ole Kortol Vs Republic (2018) eKLR, that:-",
            "“Although Section 348 of the Criminal Procedure Code bar an appeal in the case of conviction following a conviction, the only way our courts have to address whether the sentence was legal is to address whether the plea recorded in the lower court was equivocal which would make the conviction unlawful and thus implicate the legality of the sentence.”",
            "15.  In this case, there was no argument as to whether the plea was unequivocal or not.  I have however keenly perused the trial record.  I am satisfied that the plea was taken procedurally and that the Appellant understood the charge and consequences thereof when she pleaded guilty. I am therefore satisfied that the appeal against conviction contained in the fourth ground is not merited.",
            "16.  With regard to Sentencing, I take guidance from the case of Bernard Kimani Gacheru Vs Republic (2002) eKLR, where the Court of Appeal stated that:-",
            "“It is now settled law, following several authorities by this court and the high court, that sentence is a matter that rests in the discretion of the trial court. Similarly, the sentence must depend on the facts of each case. On appeal, the appellate court will not easily interfere with sentence unless, that sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case, or that the trial court overlooked some material factor, or took into account the wrong material, or acted on the wrong principle. Even if, the appellate court feels that the sentence is heavy and that the appellate court might itself not have passed that sentence, these alone are not sufficient grounds for interfering with the discretion of the trial court on sentence unless, anyone  of the matters already states is shown to exist.”",
            "17. In this case, the Appellant was charged under Section 210 of the Penal Code as read with Section 205 of the Penal Code. The provisions state:-",
            "(210)  Where a woman by any wilful act or omission causes the death of her child being under the age of twelve months, but at the time of the act or omission the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or by reason of the effect of lactation consequent on the birth of the child, then, notwithstanding that the circumstances were such that but for the provisions of this section, the offence would have amounted to murder, she shall be guilty of a felony, to wit, infanticide and may for that offence be dealt with and punished as if she had been guilty of manslaughter of the child.”",
            "(205) “Any person who commits the felony of manslaughter is liable to life imprisonment.” ",
            "18. The Penal Code provides for a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if one is convicted for the offence of infanticide.",
            "19. The wording of Section 210 of the Penal Code acknowledges the possibility of a new mother having a disturbed mind by virtue of not having recovered from the effects of child birth and the consequent effect of lactation. Though not pleaded, this court takes judicial notice that some mothers may suffer prenatal and post-natal depression also known as prenatal and postpartum depression which condition may lead such a mother to act irrationally and harm her baby.",
            "20. This court had occasion to examine more closely the application of Section 210 of the Penal Code and the causes of pre-natal and post-natal depression in the case of Nancy Cherono Vs. Republic, Bomet Criminal Appeal No. 33 of 2018 (2021) eKLR and had this to say:-",
            "(42)  At this point I make the strong observation that the trial court was faced with a phenomenon less appreciated in our jurisprudence.  Whereas Section 210 of the Penal Code which creates the offence of infanticide recognizes the possibility that child birth can cause the disturbance of balance of mind of a new mother, the depth and breadth of that disturbance is yet to be grasped by our criminal justice.",
            "(46) By definition, postpartum depression refers to a non-psychotic mood disorder that can affect women during perinatal period to one year after childbirth.  There are two categories of this kind of mood disorder i.e. antepartum depression which occurs before birth and postpartum which occurs after birth.  A research study conducted in Nakuru Level 5 Hospital indicated that most women who are affected suffer because of barriers to early diagnosis and treatment.  The study stated that mothers required psychosocial support during the perinatal period and that such support should target victims of Gender Based Violence and offer family support[1].  It listed symptoms of post-partum depression to include the following:- ",
            "(i) Depressed mood or severe mood swings",
            "(ii) Excessive crying",
            "(iii) Difficulty bonding with the baby",
            "(iv) Withdrawing from family and friends",
            "(v) Loss of appetite or eating much more than usual",
            "(vi) Inability to sleep (insomnia) or sleeping too much",
            "(vii) Overwhelming fatigue or loss of energy",
            "(viii) Reduced interest and pleasure in activities one used to enjoy",
            "(ix) Intense irritability and anger",
            "(ix) Fear that one is not a good mother",
            "(x) Hopelessness",
            "(xi) Feelings of worthlessness, shame, guilt or inadequacy",
            "(xii) Diminished ability to think clearly, concentrate or make decisions",
            "(xiii) Restlessness",
            "(xiv) Severe anxiety and panic attacks",
            "(xv) Thoughts of harming oneself or baby; and;",
            "(xvi) Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide",
            "(52) It is now clear from the above referred studies that post-partum depression is a condition which prima facie can be said to be outside the control of the individual mother affected.  It is my view that more local scientific studies ought to be undertaken in order to inform the necessary medical interventions. ",
            "21. In this case, the trial court did not have the benefit of the accused person’s testimony because she pleaded guilty.   However, from her submissions in this court, she indicated that she was 22 years old, a single mother and the breadwinner in her family. That she had given birth in prison as she was imprisoned while pregnant. In her submissions, she stated that her husband begun quarrelling her when he realized she was pregnant. That the husband denied responsibility for the pregnancy and took her to his parent’s home.",
            "22. A Probation Report was filed in court on 2nd September 2021 and it indicated that the Appellant went to school upto class 6 where she was forced to drop out of school due to teenage pregnancy. That after staying at home for a while, she settled for marriage with one Wilson Kimetto. The Probation Report further stated that their marriage became rocky and the Appellant alleged that while at their matrimonial home, her husband became hostile to her while attempting to drive her back to her parents’ home (sic!).",
            "23. From the above, it is clear to this court that the circumstances that the accused person faced could possibly have caused her to suffer some depression either pre-natal or post-natal as contemplated by Section 210 of the Penal Code.  I must hasten to clarify that such state of mind does not justify the unlawful act.  However, a clear appreciation of the circumstances faced by the Appellant in the light of the likely causes of post-partum depression would lead the court to an appropriate sentence for the offence. ",
            "24. In the persuasive South African case of S. vs. Campher 1987, 1 SA, 940 (A), the court held that:-",
            "“A mental illness that has the specified effect can be temporary or permanent. The only factor that is taken into account is the fact that the mental illness existed at the time of the commission of the act. This guideline is very important for the purpose of postnatal depression due to the varying lengths of symptoms associated with the condition. In most instances, the accused will no longer be suffering from any symptoms by the time that the case is actually before that court. In view of the above, the trial court should have considered the state of mind of the accused at the time of committing the offence and not merely during trial.”",
            "25. It is trite that the purpose of sentencing is retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation and restitution. The court must therefore consider an appropriate sentence for such an offence. In the case of Gladys Kemunto Onduso Vs. Republic (2009) eKLR, the Appellant was charged, convicted and sentenced to 7 years imprisonment for the offence of attempted infanticide.  On appeal, she was released by the Appellate Court upon consideration of the fact that she was a first offender and that she had expressed willingness to take care of her new born baby.",
            "26. The Probation Report in this case indicated that the Appellant was a first offender and that she was remorseful. It further stated that her family was ready to receive her back home and she would be assisted to reunite with her child while she nurses her new born. In mitigation, the accused person prayed for forgiveness and a second chance to take care of her infant children at home.",
            "27. It is clear to this court that the Appellant is remorseful and desires to turn her life around.  Her demeanor when urging her appeal demonstrated the remorse.  This court has no doubt that she requires rehabilitation, psychosocial support, and societal reintegration. ",
            "28. The Appellant will benefit from the leniency of this court bearing in mind the circumstances elucidated above.  The Appeal succeeds and to the extent of the Sentence only.",
            "29. I set aside the 7 year imprisonment term and substitute therefor a 3 year probation sentence.  She shall attend mandatory counselling and socio-economic empowerment training as directed by the Probation Officer in collaboration with the National and County Governments’ departments of Gender, Youth, Sports, Culture and Social Services.",
            "30. Orders accordingly.",
            "JUDGMENT DELIVERED, DATED AND SIGNED THIS 24TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 2021.",

            "(Being an appeal arising from the conviction and sentence by Hon. G. P. Omondi ",
            "(SRM) in original Bungoma Sexual Offences Case No. 78 of 2018 dated 9th November 2019)",
            "JUDGMENT",
            "1. The Appellant was charged with the offence of defilement contrary to section 8(1) as read with section 8(2) of the Sexual Offences Act, 2006. The particulars were that on the 8th of July 2016 at [particulars withheld] Village within Bungoma County, he intentionally and unlawfully caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of NSD (Name redacted to protect the identity of the minor), a child aged 9 years.",
            "2. He faced an alternative charge of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to section 11(1) of the Sexual Offences Act, 2006. The particulars were that on 8th of July 2016 at [particulars withheld] Village within Bungoma County, he intentionally and unlawfully caused his penis to touch the vagina of NSD (Name redacted to protect the identity of the minor), a child aged 9 years",
            "3. A summary of prosecution’s case is that on 8th July 2016 at around 8:00a.m NSD was dressing in her bedroom preparing to go to school when the appellant, who is her stepfather and lived with her, caught her in a state of undress. The appellant had a vest and no underpants. In the words of NSD, the appellant then “took his thing for urinating and put it in my place for urinating” while they were both standing. The appellant penetrated his penis into NSD’s vagina for approximately 5 minutes while she screamed in pain. When he had finished he threatened to kill NSD if she told anybody what had happened. NSD then went to school looking sick on the day in question.",
            "4. Two days later NSD divulged to her elder brother what had befallen her and he in turn informed their mother PW2. The matter was also reported to PW3, the village elder. Together PW3 and PW4 made the arrest of the appellant on 23rd July 2016 and took him to Nzoia police station.",
            "5. NSD was taken to Bungoma District Hospital where upon examination it was concluded that she had been defiled. The appellant was subsequently charged as read above.",
            "6.  In his unsworn testimony in his defence, and without calling any witnesses, the appellant told the court that he had caried out his duties as a security guard on the date in question until 10:00a.m. That he went home to have lunch with PW1. He denied the offence.",
            "7. At the close of the trial, the appellant was found guilty and convicted on the main charge. He was sentenced to a term of ten (10) years imprisonment.",
            "8. Dissatisfied with the sentence the Appellant filed an appeal on the grounds that he was a first offender and that he was remorseful. He stated that the sentence was harsh and excessive: that the prosecution witnesses fabricated evidence against him: that the evidence adduced by the prosecution witnesses was too weak to warrant a conviction and that the appellant and the family of NSD were on good terms.",
            "9. The parties filed their respective submissions to the appeal which have been duly considered. In summary the prosecution submitted that it was commendable that the appellant was remorseful. However they submitted that the trial court had imposed a lenient sentence considering that the Sexual Offences Act imposed life imprisonment upon conviction where the complainant is 9 years old. Lastly the prosecution submitted that the evidence adduced proved the three(3) essential ingredients to convict a person for a charge of defilement namely, that there was penetration, that the complainant was a minor and that the penetration was caused by the appellant. The prosecution urged the court to dismiss the appeal and uphold the judgement, conviction and sentence.",
            "10. The appellant filed his submissions appealing for review of the sentence imposed by the court. He prayed that his sentence be ordered to commence on the date of his arrest. He quoted the case of Robert Achada Okello v. Republic (2018) in which the court held:",
            "“Under the provisio of Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the court is entitled to take into account the period the petitioner has spent in court in determining the sentence.”",
            "He further relied on the cases of Josiah Mutua Mutunga & Anor v. R (2018), which also dealt with the consideration of time served by an appellant in custody while imposing a sentence. He was satisfied with the sentence of 10 years imprisonment; save for the court to consider when it should start running.",
            "11. The only issue that arises for determination therefore is whether the sentence of 10 years imprisonment imposed by the trial court upon the appellant is harsh and excessive as to warrant interference by this court. Further, whether the court should consider the period the appellant had spent in custody in determining the sentence.",
            "12. It is trite law that sentencing is a discretionary exercise. However before a sentence is imposed the court is bound to consider the law creating the offence for which sentence is imposed, as well as the sentence and/or sanction prescribed under the law. The court will also consider the mitigation tendered by the appellant, his age, the general circumstances of the accused and the circumstances in which the offence was committed.",
            "13. The Appellant was charged with the offence of defilement contrary to section 8(1) & (2) of the Act which provides inter-alia:",
            "A person who commits an offence of defilement with a child aged eleven years or less shall upon conviction be sentenced to imprisonment for life.",
            "14. It was not disputed that the NSD was a child below 11 years of age. The prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant penetrated NSD as evinced by NSD’s testimony, the medical records and evidence presented before the trial court. The proper sentence would have been life imprisonment in line with section 8(2) of the Sexual Offences Act.",
            "15. The appellant however presented mitigating factors including stating that he was remorseful, that he had been forgiven by PW1 and that he had good ties with the family and the community. He further argued that the time served in custody totalling 3 years and 3 months ought to have been considered during his sentencing.",
            "16. The proviso to section 333 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code obligates the court to consider the time already served in custody if the convicted person had been in custody during the trial. Failure to do so impacts on the overall period of detention which may result in an excessive punishment that is not proportional to the offence committed. See Republic v. Thomas Gilbert Cholmondeley [2009] eKLR; and Charles Khisa Wanjala v Republic [2010] eKLR.",
            "17. This was considered in the case of Samuel Kereyo v Republic [2021] eKLR where the court gave full effect to section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code as follows.:",
            "“Daringly, therefore, I must admit that a sentence that does not give effect to section 333(2) of the CPC leaves the period spent in custody unaccounted for in law; hence, a deprivation of freedom arbitrarily or without a just cause contrary to Article 29(a) of the Constitution which provides that:",

            "“Re-phrasing the Sentencing Guidelines, there are four sets of factors a Court looks at in determining the appropriate custodial sentence after determining the correct entry point (which, as stated above, I have determined to be fifteen years imprisonment).  These are the following:",

            "iv. Did the offender use excessive, flagrant or gratuitous force?",
            "v. Was the offender part of an organized gang?",

This was due to the court giving consideration to the appellant’s mitigating factors during sentencing. Considering the applicable laws, this court agrees with the Respondent that the sentence imposed was lenient having in mind the age of the minor. The court will however not enhance the sentence against the appellant since he was not warned of such an eventuality at the commencement of the hearing of his appeal, if his appeal did not succeed. The appeal fails and is therefore dismissed.",

            "1) Spent.",
            "2) The Respondent be restrained from registering any leases, charges, or documents conveying any interest in land whatsoever on the indenture of conveyance of the propriety Land Reference Number 1/344 pending the hearing and determination of the application.",
            "3) The Respondent be restrained from registering any leases, charges, or documents conveying any interest in land whatsoever on the indenture of conveyance of Property Land Reference Number 1/344(hereinafter pending the hearing and determination of the arbitration presided over by the Arbiral Tribunal consisting of Engineer Isaac G Wanjohi and Mrs Florence Oduk with Paul Ngotho, HSC as umpire (hereinafter “the Arbitration.”)",
            "4) The Applicant be awarded costs of this application.",
            "2. The application is premised on the grounds set out on the face of the application and on the supporting affidavit of Michael Kimondiu.  The Applicants contend that the Respondent is the registered proprietor of the suit property Land Reference No. 1/344. The Applicants are home owners of various units of apartments in the suit land.  That when thy bought their units,  management companies were to be incorporated and each purchaser of the apartment unit was to be issued with a share certificate.  This however did not happen hence the home owners formed their home owners Association “The Applicant”.  They avered that various repairs need to be undertaken to rectify defects as the house units were apparently built off plan.  The dispute is apparently before the arbitration platform of which the claimed amount is Kshs 96,313,216/-.",
            "3. The Applicants further stated that the Respondent has not sold six units that is A1, A3, A5, B2, D1, D2 and D12 and they desire that the same be preserved. This is because the amount claimed before the arbitration platform is high and if the remaining empty units are sold, the Respondents may not be able to satisfy the arbitral award.",
            "4. The case is opposed by the Respondent via the replying affidavit of GaoRang, the General Manager of the Respondent dated 19.10.2021.  He avers that the Respondent was the developer of the apartments in question and that the said apartments were well constructed and completed and certified ready for occupation on 15.12.2014.  That as per the sale agreement, the defects liability period during which the Respondent was to rectify any defects or faults was 6 months, hence the Applicants are simply coercing the Respondents to do repairs 7 years after occupation and that there is no evidence indicating that the Respondents are incapable of satisfying an arbitral award.",
            "Determination.",
            "5. On 19.10.2021, this court gave directions for the application to be heard by way of written submissions of which the Applicant was to file and serve submissions and any further affidavit by 26.10.2021.  The Respondent was on the other hand to file and serve submissions by 2.11.2021.  Documents filed outside the given timelines were to stand as expunged. The Applicant’s further affidavit and submissions are dated 28.10.2021 which means there was no compliance with the court order.",
            "6. This court will therefore only consider the application the supporting affidavit thereof and the replying affidavit in arriving at a determination.",
            "7. The orders sought by the Applicants are in the nature of interim relief, awaiting determination of the claim they have lodged in the arbitration where they are seeking an award of Kshs 96,313,216.26. Section 7 of the Arbitration Act stipulates that:",
            "“It is not incompatible with an arbitration agreement for a party to request from the High Court, before or during arbitration proceedings an interim measure of protection and for the High Court to grant that measure.”",

            "“In issuing an interim measure of protection as provided in Section 7 the Court’s determination of the  parties’ dispute is restricted. The Court’s role was eloquently outlined in the decision of J. G. Nyamu J.A. in the case SAFARI LIMITED –Vs- OCEAN VIEW BEACH HOTEL LIMITED & 2 OTHERS (2010)eKLR where it was stated that the Court faced with such application should take into account the following:- ",
            "1. The existence of an arbitration agreement. ",
            "2. Whether the subject matter of arbitration is under threat.",
            "3. In the special circumstances which is the appropriate measure of protection after an assessment of the merits of the application\"",
            "4. For what period must the measure be given especially if requested for before the commencement of the arbitration so as to avoid encroaching on the tribunal’s decision making power as intended by the parties\"”",
            "9. The Respondent has in paragraph 18 of their Replying Affidavit recognized that arbitral awards are enforced by the High Court. In paragraph 19, they state as follows:",
            "“It is a term of the sale agreements that the parties agreed to be bound by any award made by an Arbitral Tribunal. The Respondent has therefore demonstrated its willingness to adhere to any arbitral award that may be awarded.”",
            "10. This is the closest the Respondent has come to admitting that there are ongoing arbitration proceedings.  It  therefore follows that the issues being advanced by the Respondent regarding the other terms of the sale are not issues for determination by this court. Whether the buildings were built upto standard and whether the Applicants are entitled to damages are issues tabled before the Arbitration body.",
            "11. The Respondent has also not denied that they have 6 apartments which have not been sold.",

            "The grounds of the application are that though a notice of appeal has been filed the bill was taxed but no demand was ever issued though a warrant of arrest has been issued; the applicant is unable to pay in lump sum due to poverty, family and school fee commitments.",
            "3. The 3rd respondent opposes the notice of motion through a replying affidavit sworn on 7.6.2021on the grounds that: the application is brought by a law firm improperly on record for the applicant; the taxation was done in the presence of the applicant’s counsel and hence the applicant is deemed to have been aware of the same; the application is brought after a delay of 3 months; the applicant has not handed over vacant possession leading to another suit and he is capable of paying at once since he is still benefiting from the suit land; harvesting miraa plants though illegally and it would take long to liquidate the amount.",

The judgment was delivered on 7th February 2020 after which taxation of costs was made on 10.12.2020.  A notice to show cause was taken out for hearing on 10.6.2021.  Upon service the applicant filed the current application, whereby directions were given that the application be heard before the notice to show cause is heard and determined. ",

Order 42 rule 6 grants court powers to order stay of execution if the court is satisfied that substantial loss may result to the applicant unless the order is made, it is made without unreasonable delay and lastly such security is given for due performance of such decree.  Order 21 rule 12 (1) allows a party to a decree for payment of money to pay in installments for any sufficient reason and with consent of the decree holder.",

In Kenya Shell Ltd –vs- Benjamin Karuga Kabiru & Another [1986] eKLR the court held it is not sufficient to state the decretal amount is a lot of money, an applicant must give sufficient material to enable the court exercise discretion in his favour, while in Lavington Security Ltd., Hildegard Ndalut -vs- Lelkina Dairies Ltd & Another 2005 eKLR. The court held a judgment debtor must show seriousness in paying the amount, he is bonafide by arranging fair payment proposals to liquidate the amount.",

Further it is the courts view that the question of determination, ascertainment and recording of rights and interests in land falling under an adjudication section is to be dealt with as provided under the Land Adjudication Act.  The Act provides and has an elaborate procedure on how complaints arising from the planning, demarcation and surveying of Trust land are supposed to be dealt with.",

        "judgement": [
            "RULING",
            "1. This suit was marked as settled on 30.7.2018. The Applicant/Defendant filed an application dated 2.2.2021 seeking to vary or review the orders of 30.7.2018 so as to provide for costs in favour of the Applicant.",
            "2. The Applicant contends that the advocate who appeared for them recorded that the matter was settled with costs, so Applicant proceed to file their party and party bill of costs only to later learn that the orders for costs had not been provided for. They aver that this was an omission as they had incurred costs in defending the suit.",
            "3. In their submissions, the Applicant reiterated the contents of their averments as raised in their application. In addition, they blame their advocates stating that they did not give instructions for the consent to be recorded in such terms as not to provide for costs. On this point, the Applicant cited the case of Protos Hamis Wambada & Another v Eldoret Hospital (2020)eKLR.",
            "4. The Applicant has further submitted that the Plaintiff had filed a similar suit before the tribunal prompting the current Applicant to file an application dated 23.10.2017 to have this suit dismissed. That is when the Plaintiff opted to have the suit withdrawn. In support of this point, the Applicant cited the cases of Dhiraglae J Shah & Another v Vijay Amritlal Shethia (2018) eKLR, and Owners of Motor Vessel Lillan “S” v Caltex Oil Kenya Ltd (1989) eKLR.",
            "5. Finally, the Applicant submitted that costs follow events as is provided under Section 27 of the Civil Procedure Act. It was submitted that the issue of costs was crucial but was omitted in the consent. The Applicant contends that a consent judgment/order has contractual effects just like conditions in a contract. To this end, the Applicant cited the cases of Kuwinda Rurinja Co. Limited v Andkuwinda Holdings Limited & 13 Others (2019) Eklr, Flora Wasike vs. DestinoWamboko (1988)eKLR and Purcel v F C Trigell Ltd (1970) 2All ER 671, Winn LJ said at 676 to buttress the point that a consent can only be set aside on grounds which would justify the setting aside of a contract entered into with knowledge of the material matters by legally competent persons.",
            "6. The Applicant also relied on the case of Morgai Air Cargo Limited v Guvet Enterprises Limited (2014 eKLR where the court stated thus in relation to compromise of suit.",
            "“But, it does not necessarily mean that, where parties have entered into consent to settle a proceedings, no costs should be awarded, or there is no successful party in the matter. The incidence of settlement by consent of the parties, to my mind, is just but a vital factor the court should consider, within the circumstances of each case, in deciding whether costs are payable or not. A consent recorded in settlement of a proceeding is not an automatic disentitlement of costs and I, would, therefore, hesitate profoundly to make any generalized propositions on the law that consent is an automatic disentitlement of costs without reference to the context of the particular case.”",
            "7. In conclusion, the Applicant stated that the consent order was devoid of instructions and did not address the question of costs.",
            "8. The Application was opposed vide the replying affidavit of Peter Ogunnirai, the managing director of the Plaintiff dated 3.3.2021. He contends that Defendant was their tenant whom they served upon a notice to vacate their premises as they wanted to sell the said property but Defendant/ Applicant had declined to vacate the premises. Defendant then filed a reference to the Business Premises Rent Tribunal (BPRT) under Case No. 152 of 2016 but the parties opted to settle the matter amicably.",
            "9. The Respondent further contends that the application filed by Defendant dated 23.10.2017 in this suit was not prosecuted. This is because, the parties opted to settle the matter in terms of the consent filed in the Business Premises Rent Tribunal (BPRT) case. Thus the matter was settled with no orders as to costs. The Defendant only decided to pursue the issue of costs later. The Respondent therefore contends that there was no omission on issue of costs.",
            "10. In their submission, the Respondents reiterated their averments as set out in the replying affidavit. They added that no material has been placed before the court to prove fraud or collusion in so far as the consent recorded in this case is concerned and that the parties had opted that the only issue between the parties was payment of Kshs.5,000,000 to the Defendant/Applicant; That there is nothing to suggest that the comments made by Counsel holding brief for Mr. Kabiru were contrary to the instructions issued to Mr. Kabiru by his client (Defendant).",
            "11. In support of their case, the Plaintiffs relied on the following cases: ELC No. 46 of 2015 (Eldoret) Protos Hamis Wambada & Another vs Eldoret Hospital, Flora N. Wasike vs Detino Wamboko (1982-1988)IKAR 626, Ratilal Goordhabhai Patel v Lalji Makingi (1957) EA 314, Ulmina Mahindra Shah v Barclays Bank International (1979)KIR, I M Mwakiso vs Kenya Commercial Bank Limited CIV (APPs 28 of 1982 and 69 of 1983 and Civil Aviation No 1 of 2015 Samuel Mbugua Ikumbu vs Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd.",
            "Determination",
            "12. The issue for determination is whether this court should review the orders entered on 30.7.2018 so as to award costs of the suit to the Defendant/Applicant.",
            "13. Both parties are in agreement on the legal principles that guide a court in setting aside a consent judgment, that the consent order judgment, has contractual effect and can only be set aside on grounds which would justify the setting aside a contract. See Flora N Wasike vs Detino Wamboko (1988) eKLR.",
            "14. The orders given by the court on 30.7.2018 read as follows:",
            "“By consent this matter is marked as settled. The case shall be marked as closed.”",
            "15. Thus the plain interpretation of these proceedings is that the issue of costs was not factored in the consent of 30.7.2015. The parties have no issue with the settlement of the case save the point on costs. It follows that this is not a situation whereby the parties are reneging on the subtstrutam of the consent to have the matter settled. Borrowing the words of Gikonyo J in Morgan Air Cargo limited v Guret Enterprises Limited (2014) eKLR quoted by the Applicant, I say that “in absence of a consent stating that no costs are payable, this court falls back to its discretion which it has been said time and again should be exercised in accordance with the established legal principles not whimsically not capriciously”",
            "16. This court has keenly read the consent recorded in the Business Premises Rent Tribunal (BPRT) matter availed by the Applicant as annexture “HK 1”. The same reads as follows:",
            "1. Pursuant to the consent made on 11th August, 2016 the Tenant shall be paid five million (5,000,000).",
            "2. The Tenant’s Advocate acknowledges receipt of Kshs 500,000/_",
            "3. The Tenant shall vacate the suit property on or before 15th January 2018.",
            "4. The balances of Kshs 4,500,000 shall be paid to the Tenant immediately after confirmation by the parties Advocates that the Tenant has vacated and after receipt of the keys of the premises by the landlord’s Advocates.",
            "17. The suit filed by the Plaintiff was apparently for inter alia, the eviction of the Defendant/Applicant. The parting of ways of the two litigants as a landlord and tenant were aptly captured in the aforementioned consent before the Business Premises Rent Tribunal (BPRT).",
            "18. A perusal of the records in this file indicate that from an early stage, the issue of settlement was at the core of the proceedings. The very first time that both counsels for the litigants appeared in court was on 24.4.2017 and the proceedings there in are captured as follows:",

            "RULING",
            "1. This ruling pertains to the Applicant’s Notice of Motion dated 7th June 2021 which was filed together with the Originating Summons. In the said application the Applicant seeks a temporary injunction to restrain the Defendant/Respondent by himself, his children and/or family members, agents, servants, assignees, legal representatives or any other persons  acting on his instructions directly or indirectly from entering into a portion of land measuring 0.3 Hectares or thereabouts forming part of land parcel number SOUTH MUGIRANGO/BOIKANGA/2432 registered in the name of the Respondent and evicting the Applicant and/or demolishing the Applicant’s church or damaging the church building or doing any other thing whatsoever which is meant to prevent the Applicant’s members from worshipping or in any way interfering with the Applicant and her members’ peaceful occupation, possession and/or use of the said portion of land  pending the hearing and determination of the suit herein.",
            "2.  The application is premised on the grounds set forth in the Notice of Motion and the Supporting Affidavit of Father Richard Nyangoto sworn on the 7th June 2021. The gist of the said affidavit is that the Applicant church was given a portion of the suit property by one Basibika Nyarangi as a gift way back in 1989. The Applicant initially constructed a temporary church in 1992 where her members have been worshipping.  They subsequently started constructing a permanent church in 2015 without any objection from the Respondent.  The Applicant only became aware that the Respondent had been registered as the owner of the suit property when he fenced off the suit property and demanded that the Applicant stops holding its church services in the said church.  It is the Applicant’s contention that since the church has been in peaceful and uninterrupted occupation of the suit property since 1989, she is entitled to the same by way of adverse possession.",
            "3. In response to the application the Respondent filed a Replying Affidavit sworn on the 9th July 2021 in which he depones that he was registered as the owner of the suit property in 2011 as per the annexed title deed. He avers that the suit property was purchased by his father in 1977 but he died before it was transferred to him. The suit property was subsequently registered in the Respondent’s name to hold the same in trust for his siblings. He further depones that the land was initially registered as L.R No. SOUTH MUGIRANGO/BOIKANGA/2111 and it was subsequently sub-divided into 3 portions being SOUTH MUGIRANGO/BOIKANGA/2431, 2432 and 2433.",
            "4. It is his contention that Basibika Nyarangi who is alleged to have donated a parcel of land to the Respondent is the registered owner of L.R No SOUTH MUGIRANGO/BOIKANGA/2431 while he is the registered owner of L.R No SOUTH MUGIRANGO/BOIKANGA/2432 and therefore the Applicant has no lawful claim over his land.",
            "5. The Respondent further contends that the Applicant has not demonstrated that they are entitled to the suit property by way of adverse possession nor have they met the   threshold for a temporary injunction.",
            "6. The court directed that the application be canvassed by way of written submissions and both parties filed their submissions which I have considered.",
            "ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION",
            "7. The main issue for determination is whether the Applicant has met the conditions for the grant of a temporary injunction.",
            "ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION ",
            "8.  The conditions that one must meet in order for the court to grant a temporary injunction were set out in the case of Giella V Cassman Brown & Company Ltd 1973 EA 358 which are as follows:",
            "“First, the applicant must show that he has a prima facie case with a probability of success. Secondly, an interlocutory injunction will not normally be granted unless the applicant might otherwise suffer irreparable injury which would not adequately be compensated by damages. Thirdly, if the court is in doubt, it will decide the application on a balance of convenience.”",
            "9. In the case of Mrao V First American Bank of Kenya Limited (2003) eKLR Bosire JA (as he then was) stated as follows:",
            "“A prima facie case is one which on the material presented to the court a tribunal properly directing itself will conclude that there exists a right which has apparently been infringed by the opposite party as to call for an explanation or rebuttal from the latter”",
            "Whether the Plaintiff has demonstrated that he has a prima facie case with a probability of success",
            "10. Learned counsel for the Plaintiff contended that the Plaintiff is entitled to a portion of the suit property currently registered in the Defendant’s name measuring 0.3 Hectares by way of adverse possession as the Plaintiff has been in quiet, peaceful and uninterrupted occupation of the said portion since 1989. It is his further contention that adverse possession can only be proved at the main hearing. Counsel has placed reliance on the case of Nguruman Limited V Jan Bonde Nielsen & 2 Others ( 2014) eKLR where the Court held as follows:",
            "“We reiterate that in considering whether or not a prima facie case has been established, the court does not hold a mini-trial and must not examine the merits of the case closely. All that the court is to see is that on the face of it the person applying for an injunction has a right which has been or is threatened with violation. Positions of the parties are not to be proved in such a manner as to give a final decision in discharging a prima facie case. The applicant need not establish title. It is enough it he can show that he has a fair and bona fide question to raise to the existence of the right which he alleges. The standard of proof of that prima facie case is on a balance or as otherwise put on a preponderance of probabilities. This means that the court takes the view that on the face of it the applicant’s case is more likely than not to succeed.” ",
            "11. This position was also stated in the case of Mbuthia v Jimba Credit Corporation Ltd (1988) KLR where the court stated that:",
            "“In an application for interlocutory injunction, the court is not required to make final findings of contested facts and law and the court should only weigh the relative strength of the parties’ cases”",
            "12. The principle that can be gleaned from the above cited case is that at this interlocutory stage, the court should not make up its mind on whether the Applicant has a foolproof case as all that the Applicant needs to demonstrate is that he has an arguable case. In the circumstances, I am of the view that the Applicant has demonstrated that she has a prima facie case with a probability of success.",
            "13. The second condition which the Applicant must satisfy is to demonstrate that if the order of injunction is not granted, the Applicant shall suffer irreparable loss.",
            "14. It is not in dispute that the Applicant has constructed a building on the suit property where they have been worshipping for almost 30 years. Even though counsel for the Respondent has argued that they could look for an alternative place of worship, it is not lost to me that the reason why the church was built on the suit property was to cater for those who could not walk long distances to the next church. In the case of Evans Muuru David v James Njenga Ndungi & Another (2013) eKLR the court observed as follows:",
            "“Given the circumstances of the matter, in the event that the applicant is successful at the trial, damages would not be an adequate remedy considering he plaintiff has a building on the suit premises and unless a conservatory order is given, the building could be demolished before the suit is determined”. ",
            "15. Lastly, regarding the balance of convenience, I am of the considered view that the Applicant who has invested in the suit property would be greatly inconvenienced if her worshippers who have been worshipping in the Church constructed on the suit property are prevented from accessing the church before the case is heard and determined. The balance of convenience therefore tilts in favour of the Applicant. However, the Applicant should not carry out any further developments on the suit property pending the hearing and determination of this suit.",
            "16. The upshot is that the application is merited and I grant it and make the following orders:",
            "a) A temporary injunction is hereby granted restraining the Defendant/ Respondent by himself, his children and/or family members, agents, servants, assignees, legal representatives or any other persons  acting on his instructions directly or indirectly from entering into a portion of land measuring 0.3 Hectares or thereabouts forming part of land parcel number SOUTH MUGIRANGO/BOIKANGA/2432 registered in the name of the Respondent and evicting the Applicant and/or demolishing the Applicant’s church or damaging the church building or doing any other thing whatsoever which is meant to prevent the Applicant’s members from worshipping or in any way interfering with the Applicant and her members’ peaceful occupation, possession and/or use of the said portion of land  pending the hearing and determination of the suit herein.",
            "b) The Applicant shall occupy and use the suit property but she shall not carry our any further developments on the suit property until the case is heard and determined.",
            "c) If this suit is not set down for hearing within one year the orders of injunction shall automatically lapse.",
            "d) The costs of this application shall be in the cause.",

            "(Being an Appeal from the ruling and order in Oyugis Principal Magistrate’s ",
            "PMCC No. 87 of 2018 by Hon. J.P. Nandi – Principal Magistrate).",
            "JUDGMENT",
            "1.   Sasah General Merchants Ltd and Samwel Odhiambo Akumu, the appellants herein, had filed an application dated 12th September, 2019 under Order 10 Rule 11 and Order 51 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules. They were seeking orders to vacate the exparte judgment entered against them on grounds that they were not served with Summons to enter appearance. The application was dismissed.",
            "2.   The appellants were aggrieved by the said ruling and filed this appeal through the firm of Oguttu, Ochwangi, Ochwal & Company Advocates. Fourteen grounds of appeal were raised  as follows:",
            "a)   The learned principal magistrate erred in fact and law in finding and holding that the appellants herein, failed and/or neglected to file written submissions, in respect of the Notice of Motion application dated 12th day of September, 2019, obvious of the written submissions which were duly filed and paid for on the 23rd day of October, 2019 and thus formed part of the record of the honorable court.",
            "b)   In finding and holding that the appellants herein had not filed written submissions, (which finding is erroneous.), the learned trial magistrate failed to appreciate the totality of the documents obtaining and available in the court file.",
            "c)   The learned trial magistrate erred in law in finding and holding that insofar as the appellants had not filed written submissions, (which finding is slanted), the failure placed the appellants herein in the position of a party who had failed to attend and/or appear before the honorable court at the time of (sic) hearing of the application.",
            "d)   The learned trial magistrate erred in law in finding and holding that the affidavit of service, (sic) sworn on the 29th day of October, 2018 and which was the foundation of the default judgment, was legally tenable and/or in compliance with the provisions of Order 5 Rule 15 of the Civil Rules, 2010, notwithstanding the apparent and discernable defects, evident on the face thereof.",
            "e)   The learned trial magistrate erred in fact and in law in not finding and holding that the affidavit of service at the foot of the purported default judgement, was omnibus insofar as the said affidavit of service, was devoid and/or bereft of salient and pertinent statutory features, inter alia the names, description of the person (sic) served with the court process.",
            "f)   The learned trial magistrate erred in law in failing to find and hold that the draft statement of defence, filed and/or mounted by and/or on behalf of the appellants herein, raised pertinent and bona-fide triable issues, sufficient to warrant liberty to defend the suit before the subordinate court.",
            "g)   In dismissing the Notice of Motion application by and/or on behalf of the appellants, seeking to set aside the irregular default judgment, the learned trial magistrate denied and/or deprived the appellants of a Constitutional entitlement, donated by dint of Article 27, 48 & 50(1) of the Constitution, 2010.",
            "h)   In any event, in failing to afford the appellants a right of audience, pertaining to and/or concerning the proceedings before the subordinate court, the learned trial magistrate proceeded to and condemned the appellants unheard and thus violating the doctrine of the rules of natural justice.",
            "i)    The learned trial magistrate, having correctly quoted a number of binding decisions pertaining to setting aside of default/ex-parte judgments and having correctly observed the hackneyed principle that jurisdiction to set aside is unfettered, same proceeded to disregard and/or ignored the set principles and thereby fettered his discretion and/or jurisdiction and thus occasioned a miscarriage of justice.",
            "j)    In finding and holding that the default/ex-parte judgment, which was the subject of the Notice of Motion application for setting aside, was regular, the learned trial magistrate failed to appreciate and/or apprehend the requisite provisions of Order 5 Rule 15, 16 & 17 of the Civil Procedures Rule, 2010.",
            "k)   The learned trial magistrate erred in law in dismissing the Notice of Motion application dated the 12th day of September, 2019 and thereby grating liberty for execution proceedings, notwithstanding failure to comply with and/or adhere to the provisions of Order 22 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010, consequently, the learned trial magistrate sanctioned illegal proceedings and/or execution, to the prejudice of the appellants.",
            "l)    The learned trial magistrate erred in fact and in law in failing to fully appreciate, analyze and or evaluate the totality of Evidence on record as well as the submissions, filed and or lodged by the parties and in particular, the written submissions filled on behalf of the appellants, which in any event, were ignored per incuriam.",
            "m)  The decision and or ruling of the learned trial magistrate, amounts to and or constitutes punishment to the appellants in lieu of rendering Justice.  Consequently, the appellants have been subjected to condemnation and or deprivation of the right to natural justice.",
            "n)   The ruling of the learned trial magistrate is contrary to the provisions of Order 21 Rule 4 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2019, consequently, the ruling and or decision is a nullity.",
            "3.   The appeal was opposed by the respondent through the firm of Nyatundo & Company Advocates. The respondent contended that:",
            "a)   The appellants were duly served.",
            "b)   The appeal lacks merit.",
            "4.   This Court is the first appellate court. I am aware of my duty to evaluate the entire evidence on record bearing in mind that I had no advantage of seeing the witnesses testify and watch their demeanor. I will be guided by the pronouncements in the case of Selle vs. Associated Motor Boat Co. Ltd. [1965] E.A. 123, where it was held that the first appellate court has to reconsider and evaluate the evidence that was tendered before the trial court, assess it and make its own conclusions in the matter.",
            "5.   The service of summons is provided for under section 20 of the Civil Procedure Act and Order 5 Civil Procedure Rules. Section 20 of the Civil Procedure Act provides:",
            "Where a suit has been duly instituted the defendant shall be served in manner prescribed to enter an appearance and answer the claim.",
            "The prescribed manner is provided for under Order 5 of the Civil Procedure Rules. Order 5 Rule 7 provides:",
            "Save as otherwise prescribed, where there are more defendants than one, service of the summons shall be made on each defendant.",
            "Order 5 Rule 8 on the other hand provides:",
            "(1) Wherever it is practicable, service shall be made on the defendant in person, unless he has an agent empowered to accept service, in which case service on the agent shall be sufficient.",
            "(2) A summons may be served upon an advocate who has instructions to accept service and to enter an appearance to the summons and judgment in default of appearance may be entered after such service.",
            "6.   The outstanding salient requirements of service for summons are:",
            " a) Where practicable, service to be on the defendant in person; or",
            "b) Upon an agent empowered to accept service; or",
            "c) Upon an advocate who has instructions to accept service and to enter an appearance to the summons.",
            "The affidavit of service filed in court on 19th November, 2018 and sworn by Moses Omondi Ogada indicate that he served the Summons to Enter Appearance on the Secretary. He does not give the name of the secretary. The person who signed does not indicate a name but just a signature. The court could not be able to ascertain whether such a person was empowered to accept service. Secondly, the process server did not make an attempt to establish the whereabouts of the second appellant. Thirdly, there was no return of service in respect of the first appellant.",
            "7.   I therefore find that the appellants were not served with summons to enter appearance.  The default judgment and the consequential orders are hereby set aside. The appellants are given 14 days within which to enter appearance. The appeal is therefore allowed with costs.",

The respondents do not have any evidence or proper basis to interfere with the said land parcel that absolutely belong to the applicant. The said land parcel is not on a public land. The said development is a source of rental income for the applicant herein. The applicant will suffer irreparable damage if the building is brought down the damage caused cannot be compensated by way of costs. The demolition can take place at any time and the applicant stand to suffer irreparable damage if the said orders are not granted.

That pursuant to ownership of the said property the plaintiff in 2009 put up a storey residential building, which he rented out and was attracting rental income as was indicated in the allotment letter.",
            "That sometimes on 31st March 2021 the respondents through their agents and or servants descended on the suit property without any notice and marked the same ready for demolition. On the same day the respondents also gave a verbal notice that they would at any time demolish the property together with the perimeter wall which prompted the tenants to start vacating the said property. The property is not a public land neither was the same acquired illegally.",

            "JUDGMENT",
            "Introduction",
            "1. The Claimant’s claim against the Respondent is for compensation for wrongful dismissal and payment in lieu of leave, notice and for days worked. The claim is contained in a Memorandum of Claim dated 16th June, 2017 and filed in court on 19th June, 2017.",
            "2. The Respondent filed a Memorandum of Response to the claim on the 27th of July, 2017.",
            "3. The Claimant responded to the memorandum of response on the 7th August, 2017 and filed on the 14th of August, 2017.",
            "4. At the trial, the Claimant testified on his own behalf, while the Respondent called one Mr. Samuel Maranga, its personnel officer who testified on its behalf.",
            "5. Both parties filed written submissions and which have been duly considered.",
            "The Claimant’s Case",
            "6. The Claimant’s case is that he was employed by the Respondent on 5th September, 2009 as a loader earning a wage of Kshs. 280 per day.",
            "7. It is his further case that he was later promoted to a loading supervisor and that at the time of dismissal, he was earning a gross salary of Kshs. 20,346 per month.",
            "8. The Claimant states that he was wrongfully dismissed on 13th September, 2016, for alleged careless performance of duty.",
            "9. It is his case that he was not paid his dues at the time of dismissal and seeks the following reliefs:",
            "a) A declaration that the dismissal of the Claimant is unlawful, wrongful and unfair",
            "b) Days worked……………………………………....Kshs. 9,390.46",
            "c) One month’s salary in lieu of notice ……………Kshs. 20,346.00",
            "d) In lieu of leave ……………………………...……..Kshs. 16, 433.34",
            "e) 12 months’ compensation ………………..……….Kshs. 244, 154.00",
            "f) Costs and Interests of the cause.",
            "The Respondent’s Case",
            "10. The Respondent admits that the Claimant was its employee, who worked as a Loading Assistant and earning a gross salary of Kshs. 17,222 and not Kshs. 20,436 as alleged.",
            "11. The Respondent states that the Claimant was employed by the Respondent from 1st March, 2013 and not 5th September, 2009 as alleged.",
            "12. The Respondent further states that the Claimant had several indiscipline cases, most of which bordered on theft by servant through collusion with truck drivers, which caused it massive losses.",
            "13. The Respondent states that the Claimant received several verbal warnings and that he did write apologies in response to the said warnings.",
            "14. The Respondent further states that the Claimant was given several opportunities to be heard and that a union representative appeared to represent him in the final meeting where the decision to dismiss him was reached.",
            "15. The Respondent states that the Claimant was paid all his dues upon dismissal, including his full salary for the month of September, 2016 despite working for only 12 days in that month.",
            "16. The Respondent states that that the Claimant’s case is malicious, based on falsehoods and an attempt at extorting it.",
            "17. The Respondent further states that the Claimant did not exhaust the alternative dispute resolution mechanisms available to him, and the suit should be dismissed.",
            "18. It is the Respondent’s prayer that the Claimant’s suit be dismissed",
            "Findings and Determination",
            "19. There are two issues for determination in this matter:",
            "i. Whether the Claimant was wrongfully dismissed; and",
            "ii. Whether the Claimant deserves the reliefs sought",
            "Whether the Claimant was wrongfully dismissed",
            "20. Evidence before court is that the Claimant was called to the Respondent’s Human Resources Officer’s office on the morning of 13th September, 2016 and issued with a letter of summary dismissal.",
            "21. The Claimant told court that he was not issued with notice to show cause and neither was he invited for a disciplinary hearing.",
            "22. The Respondent’s position is that a disciplinary hearing took place at the Respondent’s premises, but that the Claimant was not in attendance, instead, a union representative was invited to represent the Claimant.",
            "23. Mr. Samuel Maranga, testifying for the Respondent’s, told the court that the Respondent did not issue a show cause letter to the Claimant, but that a shop steward was asked to represent the Claimant in accordance with the policies of the Respondent.",
            "24. Minutes of a disciplinary committee meeting held on 13th September, 2016, confirms that the Claimant was not present at the disciplinary hearing.",
            "25. Section 41(2) of the Employment Act, 2007 demands that an employer before summarily dismissing an employee, shall hear and consider representations from the said employee and that the employee shall be entitled to have another employee or shop floor union representative of his choice present during the hearing.",
            "26. It is thus not enough that a union representative was present during the disciplinary hearing; without the Claimant’s attendance, the decision to dismiss was wrongful, unlawful and unfair. In the case of David Gichana Omuya v Mombasa Maize Millers Limited [2014] eKLR, the Court held that the requirements of Section 41 of the Employment Act, 2007, have a long pedigree in administrative/public law and are referred as the rules of natural justice. It is thus paramount that an employer, irrespective of the reasons for dismissal/termination, must do so within the confines of procedural fairness.",
            "27. The court finds and holds that the Claimant’s dismissal was unprocedural for having violated the provisions of Section 41 of the Employment Act and thus unfair.",
            "Whether the Claimant deserves the reliefs sought",
            "28. The Claimant has prayed that this court awards him for 12 days worked in September, 2016, a one month’s salary in lieu of notice, pay in lieu of leave, 12 months’ compensation, costs of the suit and Interests.",
            "12 days worked in September, 2016",
            "29. The Claimant’s assertion is that he was not paid for the 12 days worked in the month of September, 2016, when he was dismissed.",
            "30. The Respondent’s evidence is that the Claimant was paid full salary for the month of September, 2016, even when he had not worked the full month.",
            "31. The Respondent produced before court a September, 2016 pay slip showing that indeed the Claimant’s pay for that month was paid. Additionally, a cheque number 021041 for Kshs.5,401.00 was also produced as evidence that the Claimant was paid fully for the month subject of this claim.",
            "32. The court is convinced that the Claimant is not owed salary for the month of September, 2016 and the claim fails and is dismissed.",
            "A One Month’s Salary in Lieu of Notice",
            "33. Section 44(2) provides as follows in respective of notice during summary dismissal:",
            "“Subject to the provisions of this section, no employer has the right to terminate a contract of service without notice or with less notice than that to which the employee is entitled by any statutory provision or contractual term”.",
            "34. The contract of service produced by the Respondent between it and the Claimant, does not provide for notice period. The court will for this reason apply the one-month statutory notice period provided under Section 35 of the Employment Act, 2007.",
            "35. The court finds and holds that the Claimant was evidently not issued with any notice prior to his dismissal contrary to Section 35 of the Employment Act and for this reason the court awards him a one-month salary in lieu of notice.",
            "36. Parties to this suit did not agree on exactly how much the Claimant’s salary was. A September, 2016 pay slip produced by the Respondent, indicate that the Claimant’s gross salary was Kshs. 17,222.00, while pay slips produced by the Claimant for the months of February and May, 2016, indicated a gross salary of Kshs. 20,346.00 and Kshs. 20,253.00. respectively.",
            "37. None of the three pay slips tally on the amount of salary payable to the Claimant, and parties did not explain why the pay slips had different figure for the three months. This being the Claimant’s case, he had a higher duty to prove to the court what his monthly salary was and for having failed to do so, the court awards him one-month salary in lieu of notice at Kshs. 17,222.00.",
            "Pay in Lieu of Leave",
            "38. The Claimant stated that he did not take his leave days and neither was he paid for the same.",
            "39. The Respondent produced a pay slip for September, 2016, which pay slip, the Claimant did not deny to be his and the said pay slip indicated a leave payment of Kshs. 4,840. The Court finds and holds that the Claimant was paid leave allowance and the claim fails and is dismissed.",
            "12 Months’ Salary in Compensation",
            "40. In determining an award of compensation, the court is guided by the provisions of Section 49 of the Employment Act, 2007. In the case of Alphonce Maghanga Mwachanya v Operation 680 Limited [2013] eKLR, the Court held that in determining an award of compensation, the court is to consider the 13 factors set out under Section 49 (4) of the Employment Act, 2007. ",
            "41. The reasons put forward by the Respondent for dismissing the Claimant are that he had several indiscipline issues, most of which bordered on theft by servant through collusion with truck drivers, which caused it massive losses.",
            "42. The Respondent produced letters of apology written by the Claimant after loading excess bags of cement in trucks in the course of duty. This points to negligence of duty on the part of the Claimant. To have written two apologies within a span of two months for the same reasons, confirms that the Respondent had valid and justifiable reasons to dismiss the Claimant, save for failure to adhere to the legal requirements on procedure.",

            "RULING",
            "1.     Coming up for ruling is a Preliminary Objection dated 24th July 2013 by the Defendant raised on the following grounds;",
            "1) That the Plaintiff’s application contradicts clause 18 of the memorandum of agreement dated 26.7.2007 entered between the plaintiff and the Defendant which sets out arbitration to be used to resolve any dispute or agreement.",
            "2) This Honourable court therefore lacks original jurisdiction as it is expressly excluded by the parties who agreed to submit themselves to arbitration in the event of a dispute.",
            "2.   The Defendant in their submissions dated 9th August 2021 stated that the objection was based on a point of law as laid down in the case of Mukisa Biscuit v West End Distributors Ltd [1969] EA 696. They indicated that the contract entered into between the parties on 26th July 2007 had an arbitration clause that governed how disputes were to be resolved. In this regard, the suit was in violation of the contract and the court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the matter. Reference was made to the case of Kenneth Kinoti Muriuki & 5 others v Dinara Developers Ltd & Another (2020) eKLR.",
            "3.   The submissions of the Plaintiff are dated 21st October 2021, Just like the Defendant, the Plaintiff has relied on the  Mukisa Biscuit  case, to buttress the point that a  preliminary objection should be on a point of law. The Plaintiff however claims that the Defendant’s objection would require the court to interrogate contents of the agreement thus making the objection invalid, adding that the Environment and Land Court has constitutional and statutory powers to hear disputes pertaining to land and environment. Therefore the Preliminary Objection should be dismissed.",
            "4.     It is common practice that a preliminary objection should be raised on a point of law as has been entrenched in the case of Mukisa Biscuit v West End Distributors Ltd [1969] E.A. The Preliminary Objection dated 24.7.2013 is directed upon the plaintiff’s application dated 27.6.2012. The said application is the one filed contemporaneously with the suit seeking injunctive orders against the Defendant. The aforementioned Application and the Preliminary Objection have remained dormant for the last 9 and 8 years respectively. I discern that efforts to prosecute the two pleadings fizzled away with time due to various factors including attempts at settlement.",
            "5.      This court has a constitutional mandate to ensure that justice is expedited in line with the provisions of  Article 159 (2) (b) of the Constitution. To this end, this court will apply Active Case Management principles and techniques to ensure that the trial shall not be derailed by interlocutory issues that have been lying in slumber for the last 9 or so years. In the case of Lawrence Kinyua Mwai vs. Nyariginu Farmers Co Ltd & Another (2019) Eklr, while dismissing about 16 unprosecuted applications at one go, I stated as follows;  ",
            "“ Active Case management enhances processing efficiency, promotes court control of cases, and provides Judicial Officers with the tools that may be used to dispose off a case efficiently. These techniques reduce delays and case backlogs, and provide information to support the strategic allocation of time and resources - all of which encourage generally better services from courts”.",
            "6.   It is not fathomable that an application for injunction has remained inactive   for the last 9 years and counting. I hereby suo moto proceed to dismiss the same. There being no application anymore, it follows that the preliminary objection has been rendered superfluous and it faces the same fate of dismissal. Each party to bear their own costs in so far as the application and the preliminary objection are concerned. Parties are hereby encouraged to focus on the substantive issues in order to bring a closure to this suit.",

            "RULING",
            "1. Leonard Sigei arap Bett (the Petitioner) lodged a Petition with the Court on 17 May 2021 against the Governor, County of Bomet, the County Public Service Board, Bomet and 12 others alleging that the renewal of the contracts of the 4th to 14th Respondents as Chief Officers was unlawful because the same were not subjected to the requirements of the Public Appointments (County Assemblies) Approval Act and the County Governments Act.",
            "2. The Petitioner also alleged that the Governor, County Public Service Board and the County Assembly failure or omission to renew the contracts of the 2 Interested Parties was not based on any cogent or discernible criteria.",
            "3. The decision to reappoint the Chief Officers, the Petitioner asserted, violated Articles 47, 73 and 235 of the Constitution.",
            "4. It was further contended that no budgetary allocations had been made for the appointments.",
            "5. Filed with the Petition was a Motion under a certificate of urgency seeking interim conservatory orders.",
            "6. The Court directed the Petitioner to serve both the Motion and the Petition.",
            "7. The County Assembly filed Grounds of Opposition to the Motion and Petition on 14 June 2021.",
            "8. On the same day, the Governor filed a replying affidavit to the Motion and Petition.",
            "9. When the parties appeared before the Court on 30 June 2021, the Court directed them to file and exchange submissions on a jurisdictional question arising from Article 234(2)(i) of the Constitution as read with section 77 of the County Governments Act and sections 85, 86 and 87(2) of the Public Service Commission Act.",
            "10. The Petitioner filed his submissions on 6 July 2021, while the 5th, 6th and 9th Respondents filed joint submissions on 13 July 2021.",
            "11. The 4th and 7th Respondents filed their submissions on 19 July 2021.",
            "Submissions by the Petitioner",
            "12. The Petitioner submitted that section 77 of the County Governments Act and sections 85, 86 and 87(2) of the Public Service Commission Act only become implicated where a person is aggrieved with the decision of a County Public Service Board.",
            "13. In the instant case, the Petitioner asserted that the County Public Service Board had not made any decision that could be appealed to the Public Service Commission.",
            "14. The decision under attack, the Petitioner contended, was that of the Governor of making appointments without complying with the provisions of the Public Appointments (County Assemblies) Approval Act.",
            "15. The Petitioner further urged that under Regulation 8 of the Public Service Commission (County Governments Public Services Appeals Procedures) Regulations, 2016 did not contemplate members of the public or ordinary citizens making appeals to the Public Service Commission (it was argued that the appeal could only be made by a public officer).",
            "16. The Public Service Commission, the Petitioner, submitted, did not have appellate jurisdiction over decisions or appointments made by a Governor.",
            "17. In the same breathe, the Petitioner was of the view that the Public Service Commission could not determine constitutional questions or grant interim injunctive relief as were sought in the Motion.",
            "18. The Petitioner cited the cases of Secretary, Wajir County Public Service Board v Hulbal Gedi Abdille (2017) eKLR, James Tinai Murete & Ors v County Government of Kajiado & 22 Ors (2015) eKLR, Zena Achieng Mohamed v County Public Service Board of Kilifi & 6 Ors (2021) eKLR, Abdikadir Suleiman v County Government of Isiolo & Ar (2015) eKLR and James Ore v Office of the Governor, County Government of Marsabit & Ar (2021) eKLR.",
            "Respondents’ arguments",
            "19. For the Respondents who filed submissions, the view was taken that administrative bodies performing quasi-judicial functions could properly determine constitutional issues arising within their remit, and reliance was placed on the Supreme Court decision in Petition No. 3 of 2016, Albert Chaurembo Mumba & 7 Ors v Maurice Munyao & 148 Ors wherein the Court pronounced itself on the doctrine of exhaustion of alternative remedies before moving to Court.",
            "20. According to the Respondents, the Petitioner fell within the category of persons contemplated by section 77 of the County Governments Act, and therefore by virtue of section 77(2) of the County Governments Act, the Public Service Commission had the requisite jurisdiction over the dispute as the complaint related to the recruitment, selection, appointment and qualifications attached to the office of a chief officer.",
            "21. These Respondents further asserted that the Petitioner had not placed before the Court any evidence that the Governor had solely re-appointed the Chief Officers.",
            "22. The Court has considered both the Motion, Petition, affidavits, Grounds of Opposition and submissions.",
            "23. One of the Petitioner’s main complaints was in relation to the purported recruitment and/or appointment and qualifications of the 4th to 14th Respondents in the office(s) of Chief Officers.",
            "24. Section 77(2) of the County Governments Act mandates the Public Service Commission to hear appeals against a decision to recruit, select or appoint a person to occupy a county public service office.",
            "25. However, the section does not set out who is competent to appeal.",
            "26. Nevertheless, section 86 of the Public Service Commission Act decrees that any person who is dissatisfied or affected by a decision of any authority or person in respect of a county public service may appeal to the Public Service Commission.",
            "27. And since the recruitment and appointment of the 4th to 14th Respondents was within the jurisdiction of the county public service, it is the view of this Court that it behoved the Petitioner to exhaust the appeal procedures set out in the County Governments Act and Public Service Commission Act before moving the Court.",
            "28. In the circumstances, the Court finds that the reliance placed on Regulation 8 of the Public Service Commission (County Governments Public Services Appeals Procedures) Regulations, 2016 by the Petitioner is misplaced.",
            "29. By moving the Court before appealing to the Public Service Commission, the Petitioner was invoking the Court’s jurisdiction prematurely and this is not permitted by section 87(2) of the Public Service Commission Act.",
            "30. On the question of the Interested Parties, it is the function of the County Public Service Board to recommend to the Governor persons for appointment as Chief Officers under section 45 of the County Governments Act.",
            "31. The same Act in section 59 empowers the Board with the authority and mandate to establish and abolish offices within the county public service.",
            "32. The Governor produced before the Court a request made to the County Public Service Board to approve the establishment of the positions of Chief Officer Executive and Public Works, Transport and Chief Officer, Infrastructural Development.",
            "33. The Board approved the establishment of the offices and informed the County Government through a letter dated 1 April 2021.",
            "34. Thereafter, the positions were advertised, applicants shortlisted, and interviews conducted.",
            "35. The Court cannot, therefore, find any illegality in the establishment of the two chief officer positions held by the Interested Parties.",
            "36. The Petitioner also made an allegation that the positions had not been budgeted for. The Petitioner did not produce a copy of the budget to back up the allegations, and the Court cannot make a favourable finding on this ground.",
            "37. Lastly, the Petitioner did not place any evidence before the Court to show that the contracts of the 4th to 14th Respondents had lapsed or that they had been re-appointed unilaterally by the Governor.",
            "Conclusion and Orders",
            "38. For the above reasons, the Court declines jurisdiction and strikes out the Petition with costs to the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 9th Respondents, being the parties who filed submissions.",

            "3. Order 24 rule 4 of the Civil Procedure Rules provides where a defendant passes on and a cause of action survives or continues, the court on an application shall cause a legal representative of the deceased defendant to be made a party and if the application is not made within a year, the suit shall abate as against the deceased defendant with implications as provided under Order 24 rule 6. ",

            "6. The suit has abated as against the deceased defendant.  The plaintiff had the duty to seek to cite the legal representatives of the deceased: There is no application by the plaintiff as to whom the suit belongs to revive the it, it has already abated as against the deceased defendant.  It would therefore be premature for the applicants to seek for an extension of time to be substituted when no suit exists against them in the first instance.",

The application is brought under Order 24 rule 3 (1) yet the applicants are acting for the deceased defendant and not the plaintiffs.  They cannot purport to make the application on behalf of the plaintiff.  The deceased defendant did not file a counterclaim against the originating summons.",

Even if there was a counterclaim in Charles Mutambi Gacheri –vs- Attorney General & Another [2015] eKLR the court dismissed such a request for inordinate delay.  The defendant herein passed on over two years ago.  The plaintiff has taken no action at all to bring on board the deceased defendant legal representatives.",

            "(Being an appeal from the original conviction and sentence ",
            "by Hon. P.M Wechuli SRM in Tigania S.O No. 30 of 2017 on 6/11/2020)",
            "JUDGMENT",
            "1. The appellant, Jacob Ntoiti was charged with the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8 (1) as read with Sub-section 3 of the Sexual Offences Act No. 3 of 2006 which charge sheet alleged that on 23/8/2017 at [Particulars Withheld] location in Tigania West sub-county within Meru County, he intentionally caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of BK (“the complainant”) a child aged 10 years old.",
            "2. He also faced an alternative charge of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to Section 11(1) of the Sexual Offences Act No. 3 of 2006 on which the charge sheet alleged that on the same day and place, he intentionally touched the vagina of BK a child aged 10 years old with his penis.",
            "3. On being presented to court to face the charge, he pleaded not guilty, was tried at a prosecution where the accuser called four witnesses while the appellant gave a sworn statement in his defence. By a reserved judgment, he was convicted on the main charge of defilement and sentenced to serve  life imprisonment.",
            "4. He was dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence and lodged this appeal setting out 8 grounds of appeal as follows;",
            "a. The trial court erred in law and fact by failing to note that the prosecution did not prove its case beyond any shadow of doubt",
            "b. The trial court erred in law and fact by failing to properly establish the age of the victim i.e through age assessment and/or birth certificate, yet age of the victim was a critical element to prove the offence of defilement",
            "c. The trial court erred in law and fact by failing to observe the mandatory provisions of Article 50(2)(g)(h) of the Constitution and Section 43 of the Legal Aid Act.",
            "d. The trial court erred in law and fact by relying on fabricated, contradictory and speculative evidence which was marred with a lot of falsehood.",
            "e. The trial court erred in law and fact by failing to note that the vital witnesses (mother of the complainant, investigating officer and the accused boy) were not availed before the court to clear doubts.",
            "f. The trial court erred in law and fact by sentencing the appellant to life imprisonment on the basis of mandatory sentence as stipulated by Section 8(1) of the Sexual Offences Act which was excessive, harsh and unconstitutional considering the advanced age of the appellant.",
            "g. The trial court erred in law and fact by disregarding the facts raised in the appellant’s defence of alibi.",
            "h. The trial court erred in law and fact by convicting and sentencing the appellant on incurably defective charge sheet.",
            "5. In his submissions filed on 31/8/2020, the appellant, cited to court the decision in Philip Muiruri Ndaragua v R (2016) eKLR submitted that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, as the evidence tendered by the complainant was insufficient to sustain a conviction. He submitted that the trial court’s failure to inform him of his right to legal representation under Article 50(2)(g) of the Constitution, since he was facing a serious offence, amounted to miscarriage of justice and a violation of his right. He placed reliance on Jared Onguti Nyantika v R (2019) eKLR and Daniel Mpayo Ngiyaya v R (2018) eKLR to support that position. He submitted further that the evidence by PW5 did not link him with the offence as the doctor did not state whether the hymen was freshly broken or not. According to him, the absence of injuries, bruises, inflammation, blood and spermatozoa was proof that penetration had not been established. He referred to P.K.W v R (2012) eKLR on the numerous incidences when hymen can break, and therefore its absence alone is not sufficient proof of defilement. He alluded to material contradictions in the evidence adduced by the prosecution witnesses, which, he contends, casts doubt on their credibility and cited Rankrishan Panoya v R(1957) 339 in support of the proposition that the court should not rely upon inconsistent evidence. He submitted that he was neither positively identified as the perpetrator of the offence nor linked with its commission. He faulted the prosecution for failing to call the mother of the complainant and the accused boy, who according to him were vital witnesses, to shed light on how the complainant had been defiled. He felt that the investigating officer had conducted shallow and shoddy investigations by failing to call key witnesses to testify, then cited Bukenya v Uganda (1972) and John Kenga v R Criminal Appeal No.118 of 1984, on the need to call vital witnesses and the consequences of failure to call such witnesses.",
            "6. On sentence, he submitted that the mandatory life sentence imposed on him was harsh, excessive and unconstitutional as was stated in Christopher Ochieng v R (2018) eKLR, Jared Koita Injiri v R(2019)eKLR and Francis Karioko Muruatetu & anor v R(2017)eKLR. He faulted the trial court for rejecting his defence which not only contained some reasonable facts to support his acquittal, but also was unshaken by the prosecution case. He urged the court to scrutinize the evidence tendered by the prosecution witnesses and arrive at a different conclusion.",
            "7. In praying for his appeal to be allowed, he concluded that the charge sheet was fatally defective because he was erroneously convicted with the section he was not charged with, which occasioned miscarriage of justice and prejudiced him.",
            "8. The respondent/prosecution’s submissions were to the effect that it had proved the inextricable elements of defilement as outlined in Moses Mwarimbo Dau v R (2018) eKLR, hence the sentence meted out to the appellant was within the law. On the age of the complainant, it was submitted that the clinical card produced as Exh.5 together with the P3 form proved that the complainant was aged 10 years and the decision in Joseph Kiet Seet v R (2014) eKLR, cited for the proposition that the age of a victim can be determined by medical and other cogent evidence. The respondent then took the position that the evidence of PW1, that she had been defiled, was corroborated by PW2, PW3 and PW5. On the identification, it maintained that the evidence by PW1 on who had defiled her was corroborated by PW2 and PW3, who found him in the act in broad day light, and therefore there was no margin of error as to the identity of the assailant, who was well known to PW1. It was concluded that the appeal should be dismissed and the sentence upheld, as the evidence adduced was solid.",
            "9. In advancing its case against the appellant, the prosecution called 5 witnesses. PW1, the complainant, gave sworn testimony that the appellant, whose home was far from theirs, told her to go to his place to fetch cooking flour and she went with him. The appellant then locked the door to his one roomed house, which had plates, cups, plastic containers, a bed but there no seats. The appellant removed her biker, panty and using his “thing” did bad manners to her on the bed, at the place she used to urinate with (pointed out her crotch). She felt pain in her private parts as he did bad manners. He then left after the act and PW2 and PW3 came to look for her. They told the appellant, who was in the house, to leave her alone.  She told her mother what the appellant had done and was taken to the hospital, where tests were done and she was given medicine. She went to the police station to record her statement.",
            "10. During cross-examination, she admitted that she was in the company her 2 brothers but denied taking the appellant’s cooking flour and that it was the appellant who gave her the flour. She denied having run away leaving her friend back with some sugar.  During re-examination, she stated that it was the appellant who called her and did bad manners to her after he had requested her to go and make tea for him.",
            "11. PW2 BM, a minor gave sworn testimony that on the material day, he was looking after animals. He went to the old man’s house, where he found PW1 and the old man, sleeping on the bed without clothes. The old man was on top of PW1 and he knew they were doing bad manners. When the old man saw him, he told PW1 to wake up and make them tea. He was with PW3 when PW1 and the old man put on clothes and she made tea. They left PW1 and the old man there and went to look after goats. They came back the 2nd time and found that PW1 and the old man had removed clothes again. PW1 told their mother. They had never been to the appellant’s place before and what the old man did was wrong. He did not know the old man before but the old man had passed their home after the incident while going to the shops. After pointing at the appellant on the dock, he stated that did not know when he was arrested. The old man had told PW1 to go for cooking flour and that is how they knew she was there. The door was not locked and PW1 was not crying and she stayed at the appellant’s place for a long time.",
            "12. During cross examination, he stated that he was with PW3 and PW1 was already in the appellant’s house. The appellant called PW1 as he came from the shops to go for cooking flour. The appellant had bought 2 kilos of flour and he wanted to give him 1 kilo. The appellant told PW1 to pick the flour and take it to PW2’s elder married sister to make porridge. He stated that the appellant usually greeted them as he passed by their home. He stated that the appellant knew the husband of his married sister and that PW1 left first while they went for the goats. He denied that they had stolen any sugar and stated that their mother had told them to go and tell PW1 to go home.",
            "13. PW3 EM, a minor gave sworn testimony that on the material day at 2 pm, he and PW2 had gone to look after goats when they found the appellant, the old man in bed with PW1, their sister, in the appellant’s house. PW1 and the old man did not have clothes on and he found the old man lying on PW1. He did not know the appellant before. When the appellant saw them, he put on clothes and told PW1 to make them tea, which she did. They left PW1 and went back to the goats only to return again where they found the appellant and PW1 sleeping again. They left with goats, PW1 went home and PW2 told their father. He recorded his statement at the police but he could not remember when the appellant was arrested.",
            "14. During cross examination, he stated that the appellant had gone with PW1 to his house then PW2 and him and went later. The appellant, who neither sold flour nor had a shop, told PW1 to go for cooking flour. The appellant gave PW1 1 kilo and they left her at the appellant’s place and went with goats. There was a day the appellant had called them. It was not on Sunday the 20th but it was a Saturday.",
            "15. During re-examination, he stated that they did not steal anything from the appellant but he gave PW1 1 kilo of flour.",
            "16. PW4 PC (W) Petronila Mua based at Tigania police Station, the takeover investigating officer stated that all witnesses had testified save for the doctor. She stated that it was alleged that the appellant had defiled a minor.",
            "17. During cross examination, she stated that she was not present during the incident.",
            "18. PW5 Geoffrey Muthomi from Miathene Hospital produced PW1’s P3 form as PEx.1, Treatment notes as PEx.2, Lab form as PEx.3, Post Rape Care form as PEx. 4 and Clinical Card as PEx. 5. It was alleged that PW1 had been defiled but at the time of examination, she had taken a bath and washed her clothes. On examination, her hymen was torn and no positive lab results were seen. He made a conclusion of defilement based on the torn hymen.",
            "19. During cross examination, he stated that the appellant was not taken to the hospital for examination.",
            "20. When placed on his defence, the appellant, a resident of [Particulars Withheld], denied committing the offence. He stated that he left children at home and went to look after goats. One of them came to call him and inform him that PW1 and 2 others had taken food. They ate the food, took away maize flour and ran away. The 3 minors testified as witnesses. He followed them to their home and informed their father M. One week later, they said he had defiled the girl after which he was arrested. He stated that it was a cover up.",
            "21. During cross examination, he stated that on the material day, he was at home. He denied seeing PW1, going with her to the house, defiling her or asking her to make tea on that day.",
            "22. This being a first appeal, the court is duty bound to re-appraise and re-analyse the evidence afresh, draw its own conclusions and make its own independent findings, bearing in mind that it did not have the advantage of seeing the witnesses testify. See Collins Akoyo Okemba & 2 others v R (2014) eKLR.",
            "23. The issues for determination are whether the offence of defilement was proved beyond reasonable doubt and whether the the sentence meted out was too harsh to call for disturbance.",
            "24. The key ingredients of the offence of defilement are proof of the age of the complainant, proof of penetration and proof that the person before court was the perpetrator of the offence.",
            "25.  On age, PW5 produced the complainant’s P3 form where her age was estimated to be 10 years. He also produced the complainant’s Clinical card as PEx 5 indicating that she was born on 9/2/2007. I am therefore satisfied that the complainant was at the time of commission of the alleged offence aged 10 years old and thus a minor.",
            "26. The next element is penetration which is defined under Section 2 of the Act to mean “the partial or complete insertion of the genital organs of a person into the genital organs of another person”.",
            "27. The evidence on record which the trial court relied on to convict the appellant was the complainant’s own testimony together with the corroborative evidence of PW2, PW3 and PW5 along with the medical documents adduced therein which I have critically analyzed. In his evidence, PW5 told the court that besides the missing hymen there was no positive lab results seen. The only reason why he concluded that there was defilement was the torn hymen.",
            "28. It is clear from the P3 form that the labia minora and labia majora were intact although the hymen was torn. There was nothing else noted as the complainant had taken a bath. I must state that a missing hymen per se is not proof of penile penetration, as there are many causes of a missing, torn or broken hymen in a child. The Court of Appeal in PKW v R [2012] eKLR, observed that:",
            "  “Hymen, also known as vaginal membrane, is a thin mucous membrane found at the orifice of the female vagina with which most female infants are born.  In most cases of sexual offences, we have dealt with, courts tend to assume that absence of hymen in the vagina of a girl child alleged to have been defiled is proof of the charge.  That is however, an erroneous assumption.  Scientific and medical evidence has proved that some girls are not even born with hymen.  Those who are, there are times when hymen is broken by factors other than sexual intercourse.  These include insertion into the vagina of any object capable of tearing it like the use of tampons. Masturbation, injury and medical examinations can also rupture the hymen.  When a girl engages in vigorous physical activity like horseback ride, bicycle riding and gymnastics, there can also be natural tearing of the hymen.”",
            "29. However, PW2 and PW3 told court that they had found the appellant lying on the complainant in his bed while they were both naked. That in my view, coupled with the complainant’s own testimony is proof of penetration. Consequently, I find that penetration was established beyond reasonable doubt.",
            "30. On whether the appellant was the perpetrator, PW2 and PW3 found the appellant in the act. They testified that they left the house only to return to find the appellant and the complainant had undressed again. PW1 in her testimony narrated how the appellant had removed her biker and pant and that she felt pain when he inserted his “thing” into her private parts. That evidence was not subjected to any cross examination. PW2 and PW3 were brothers to PW1and upon cross examination told the appellant that he would pass by their home and greet them. They deemed him the person who had married their sister. From the totality of the evidence, it is clear that the appellant was well known to PW1, PW2 and PW3 prior to the incident. Evidence was also led that the offence took place in broad day light, and therefore the circumstances for positive identification were favourable.",
            "31. I therefore have no doubt in my mind that the appellant was positively identified as the perpetrator of the offence by PW1, PW2 and PW3. I find that the evidence was consistent, reliable and corroborative and that the offence was sufficiently proved beyond reasonable doubt. Having established that all the ingredients of defilement were proved to the requisite standard, I find that the conviction of the appellant was safe and deserve no disturbance.",
            "32. On the allegation by the appellant of non-consideration of his alibi defence, I find that no such defence was raised or/and existed. The appellant in his defence stated that he had been charged to cover up the alleged theft of his flour and food by PW1, PW2 and PW3. I note that the trial court keenly evaluated his defence alongside the overwhelming evidence by the prosecution witnesses, and found the same to be implausible.",
            "33. On failure by the prosecution to call PW1’s mother and the accused boy to testify, who according to the appellant were crucial witnesses, this issue has been addressed by section 143 of the Evidence Act which provides that, no particular number of witnesses shall, in the absence of any provisions of the law to the contrary, be required for proof of any fact.  In Julius Kalewa Mutungu v Republic (2005) eKLR, the court held that as a general principle, “the prosecution is granted a discretion whether or not to call specific witness and courts would not interfere with that discretion unless it is shown that the prosecution had an ulterior motive in which event it will be presumed that the witness not called would have given adverse evidence.”",
            "34. The prosecution called 5 witnesses in support of its case and I find that the evidence led herein was adequate to sustain the charge. Moreover, it would be an act in vanity for the prosecution to call superfluous witnesses just because they had been mentioned by prosecution witnesses called to testify.",
            "35. The remaining question now is whether the sentence meted out to the appellant was harsh. Section 8(2) of the Sexual Offences Act provides for a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment, where the victim is aged 11 years or less. Although the appellant was charged under Section 8(1)(3) of the Sexual Offenses Act but convicted under Section 8(1)(2) of the said Act, I find that since the age of the victim was established beyond any shred of doubt, the sentence was within the law.",
            "36. In the end, I find the appeal to be wholly unmerited and the same is hereby dismissed.",

            "JUDGMENT",
            "1. The appellant seeks to overturn the ruling made on 19.9.2019 on the grounds that: he was condemned unheard and without notice; his lawyers were properly on record; there was a consent letter between the former and incoming lawyer; this court failed to consider it was a land matter and based the ruling on technicalities instead of substantive justice.",
            "2. This being a first appeal the court is to review, rehearse and re-appraise itself on the entire pleadings, evidence and law so as to come up with its own findings and conclusions.  See Selle & Anor. –vs- Associated Motor Boat Co. Ltd. & Others [1968] E.A 123.",
            "3. The appellant as a recorded owner and vide a consent to sue dated 29.1.2013 sued the respondent seeking eviction from L.R 616 Ankamia Adjudications Section which the respondent had allegedly forcefully entered into on 29.7.2013.",
            "4. The respondent denied the claim on the basis that the suit land was family/ancestral land which he was lawfully occupying with his family since 1987, the plaintiff’s late husband was an elder step-brother to his father, alleged the recording in favour of the appellant was fraudulent and or secretly done, and was holding the land in trust for him and his family.",
            "5. Further, the respondent stated the case had been filed to pre-empt the outcome of an objection No. 697 filed by him on 23.8.2018. The court directed the parties to address it over the issue of jurisdiction.",
            "6. The plaintiff/appellant by written submissions, urged the court to find the case was not based on which, AR objection had been heard and determined, but was over illegal occupation.  Further the appellant submitted no objection proceedings were exhibited in the list of exhibits and that a mere receipt could not suffice under Section 26 G (2) of Cap 283.",
            "7. The respondent submitted  the case was filed to pre-empt A/R objection No. 697 as per an attached receipt to the written submissions hence the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the suit under Sections 17, 18, 19 and 26 of the Land Consolidation Act as read together with Section 29 of the Land Adjudication Act.",
            "8. The respondent relied on the case of Stephen Michuki Kiunga-vs- Nkuni M’Turuchiu & 2 Others on the proposition that the appellant ought to have exhausted the internal dispute mechanism under the above Acts before resorting to court.",
            "9. In line with Owner of the Motor Vehicle M.V Lillians –vs- Caltex Oil (K) Ltd [1989] KLR1, the respondent urged the court to find it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the matter.  By a ruling delivered on 11.10.2018 the trial court made a finding by dint of a receipt dated 17.4.2012 the appellant ought to have appealed in line with Section 26 (1) & (2) of the Land Consolidation Act Cap 283 and that by bringing the suit the appellant was circumventing clear procedures as provided by statute.  The suit was struck out with costs.",
            "10.  Immediately after the ruling the law firm of Elijah K. Ogoti & Co. Advocates came on record through a notice of appointment of advocates on 19.10.2018 and filed a notice of motion seeking for review of the orders striking out the suit and for summons against the District Land Adjudication Officer Tigania West/East to confirm if A/R objection No. 697 was spent, had abated and was non-existent.",
            "11.   The basis of the review was that new and important point had been discovered that the A/R objection alleged the basis of striking out the suit was dismissed or abated after the land committee was disbanded as per Section 181 (a) & (b) of the Land Adjudication Act a fact which was not within the knowledge of the previous counsel on record.",
            "12.   The application was supported by an affidavit sworn by the appellant on 24.10.2018 in which she enclosed annexture EOK “1” confirming the closure and disbandment of the land committee.",
            "13.  The trial court dismissed the application on 3.12.2018 for no-attendance and non-prosecution subsequent to which an application dated 20.12.2018 for setting aside orders of 3.12.2018 and reinstatement of the application for hearing on merits was filed based on the reason that was served.",
            "14.  The application was supported by an affidavit sworn by Elijah Ogoti advocate giving a narration of the events since the filing and subsequent dismissal.",
            "15.   The respondent filed a replying affidavit saying the dismissal was lawfully done for non-attendance and non-prosecution.",
            "16.   Through a ruling made on 19.9.2019 the court held the application had been filed by a law firm improperly on record contrary to Order 9 rule 9 of Civil Procedure Rules for two law firms could not act alongside each other.  It dismissed the application leading to the current appeal.",
            "ANALYSIS AND FINDING",
            "17.  The appellant takes the view the trial court dwelt on technicalities and not the merits of the land matter hence, condemned her unheard.",
            "18. Having looked at the pleadings and the lower court record, there is no doubt the court based its determination on the issue as to whether it had jurisdiction based on a receipt introduced to court through written submissions by the respondent.  The appellant was not given an opportunity to make presentations over the authenticity of the receipt.  There were no objection proceedings attached to the statement.  Similarly the defendant had not raised the issue of jurisdiction at all in his pleadings.",
            "19.   Being a preliminary objection, the court should not have based its determination solely on a receipt and make a finding that it had no jurisdiction without interrogating the veracity or otherwise of the respondent’s allegations.",
            "20.  Secondly the trial court held the firm of Elijah Ogoti & Co. Advocates was improperly on record and hence could not lodge the application dated 20.12.2018.",
            "21.  In Speedwall Building Technologies Ltd. –vs- County Government of Migori [2018] eKLR the court held legal representation was a Constitutional right and there exists no bar in law to a party being represented by more than one law firm if such a party can afford it.",
            "22.   Thirdly,  and more important, the appellant had based the application for review under Order 45 of Civil Procedure Rules on discovery of new and important point that the alleged A/R objection had abated, or was dismissed and the land committees disbanded by dint of Section 181 of the Land Consolidation Act.",
            "23.   The replying affidavit by the respondent did not specifically deny that fact he had already lost the objection and the process was awaiting issuance or title deed in favour of the appellant.   To my mind the trial court should have determined that point on merits for it went to the core of substantial justice, as opposed to technicalities in line with Article 159 of the Constitution as read together with Section 1A, 1B and 3A of the Civil Procedure Act.",
            "24.   Fourthly, the appellant’s counsel gave a reasonable explanation as to why he did not attend court on 3.12.2018.  The court minute for 24.11.2018 clearly indicates the firm of Elijah Ogoti & Co. advocates for the plaintiff and Mwenda for the defendant by consent took a mention date for 20.12.2018.  How then the date was changed to 3.12.2018 is not clear.  Mr. C.P. Mbaabu advocate did not deny those facts that one Mwenda from his law firm had taken another date and not 3.12.2018.  It is therefore my finding that the appellant was condemned unheard.",

            "JUDGMENT",
            "1. The Petitioner sued the Respondent seeking judgment against the Respondent for:-",
            "a) A declaration that the Respondent violated the rights of the Petitioner under Articles 27, 28 and 47 of the Constitution.",
            "b) A declaration that the Respondent breached the Contract of Employment by failure to provide a medical cover for the Petitioner.",
            "c) Damages for discrimination on account of pregnancy and denial of right to dignity with interest thereon from the date of judgment until payment in full.",
            "d) General damages for breach of contract.",
            "e) General damages for unfair termination.",
            "f) Payment of all salary deductions.",
            "g) Any other orders/ reliefs that this honourable court may seem fit.",
            "h) Costs of this Petition.",
            "2. The Petitioner avers that she was employed by the Respondent on 7th July 2018 as Category Manager on a 2-year renewable contract and that she when she got pregnant, she notified the employer in September 2018. She avers that she unfortunately had a troublesome pregnancy and was in and out of hospital for the first three months and the Respondent began being hostile to her and constantly accused her of non-performance. The Petitioner avers that she also experienced unnecessary salary deductions and was forced to forfeit many leave days and that the Respondent then began to pressure her to resign and further put pressure on the HR Manager to sack her for being expensive to keep. That her dignity was constantly under attack during the monthly meetings where she would receive a thorough dress down from the Country Director on allegations of non-performance. She contends that was entitled to a medical cover under her contract of service but incurred a lot of medical expenses and missed several doctor’s appointments since the Respondent did not provide the same. She further avers that when she returned from her maternity leave in September 2019 she was immediately asked to resign and when she refused to do so, was summarily terminated by the employer on 16th September 2019. The Petitioner avers that the Respondent violated Article 27 of the Constitution which prohibits discrimination on any ground including pregnancy; Article 28 which provides the right of every person to inherent dignity and to have that dignity respected and protected; and Article 47 which protects the right to fair administrative action. The Petitioner avers that contrary to the said Constitutional provisions, the constant accusations of non-performance mostly during her pregnancy and while on maternity leave were malicious, and especially being accused of not performing even while on maternity leave. That she had to endure a toxic working environment and assigned a category of selling fashion which was not fast-moving and the same used as a basis of her evaluation and that her products were also not being pushed because of sabotage by the marketing team. Further, while on maternity leave her salary was delayed without any justifiable reason and led to untold financial suffering and when she refused to bow to the Respondent’s pressure to resign, she was fired. The Petitioner believes that the Respondent terminated her employment mainly because of her pregnancy and the medical complications tied to it.",
            "3. The Petitioner further avers that the Respondent never conducted any disciplinary hearing before terminating her employment on the basis of performance as required by law and that the grounds given for the termination are also curious and unlawful. That the Respondent cited redundancy as the reason for termination but never informed her and the Labour Office of any redundancy as required by law and that there was also no explanation as to how the decision to declare her redundant was reached, further because she was the only one affected. Further, that the Respondent never paid her severance pay for the alleged redundancy. In her Supporting Affidavit, the Petitioner depones that her duties included looking for vendors and signing them up on the Respondent’s online platform, seller screening, listing targets and sales, product selection for promotion, deals and seller margin, and coordination with Accounts/Finance for payments to sellers. She further avers that after proceeding for maternity leave in the beginning of June 2019, she incurred medical expenses amounting to Kshs. 107,573.07 because the Respondent deprived her of a medical cover and that her June salary was also delayed by the then Finance Manager of the Respondent, Adarsh Agrawal, who claimed that there was no proviso for maternity leave in the company. That the said Adarsh also called to inform her that she would be paid only 30% of her salary during her maternity leave and that it was only after she challenged him to put the same in writing that he released her salary. Further, the Respondent also delayed her August 2019 salary for 16 days. She annexes several emails in support of her averments against the Respondent and also annexes her offer letter showing that the Respondent had offered a medical cover to her. The Petitioner depones that Sanjay sent her a termination notice via email on 16th September 2019 stating that her services were no longer required and she believes the termination violated the Constitution and Employment Laws.",
            "4. Respondent’s Case",
            "The Respondent filed a Replying Affidavit sworn on 9th March 2020 by its Manager, Sanjay Pathak who avers that the Respondent had discovered that the medical documents presented by the Petitioner were fraudulently obtained for the sole purpose of getting sick leave. He depones that the Petitioner was the least performing personnel and when confronted she made false and baseless accusations. He admits that the Petitioner’s contract of service included a medical cover but avers that the same was not achieved for all the employees due to financial constraints in the company and that the company however maintained monthly subscriptions to National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) which the Petitioner could have utilized. It is his averment that the Petitioner was employed by the Respondent on contract basis and was hence not on permanent employment terms, that she was never arbitrarily dismissed and that upon termination of the contract she was paid one month salary in lieu of notice. He also contends that the Petition does not meet the constitutional threshold and that no damages are awardable to the Petitioner as she has not discharged her burden of proof on the claim for compensation. He prays for the Petition dated 17th December 2019 to be dismissed with costs.",
            "5. The Petitioner then filed a Further Affidavit sworn on 13th October 2020 by Beth Murugi Wambugu who was formerly employed by the Respondent as a HR Manager on contract. Ms. Beth avers that she began facing some difficulty in the execution of my HR functions since the CEO, Sanjay, refused to follow the law in regards to basic human resource issues such as the confirmation of staff they had hired. That she continued to put Sanjay to task over the provision of a medical cover as had been stipulated in the employment contracts but he was noncommittal on delivering on this promise. She confirms the Petitioner informed her of her pregnancy in September 2018 and asserts that she had no issued with the Petitioner’s diligence or work ethic as she performed well and met her expectations. She further avers that despite the Petitioner always producing the necessary medical proof and still putting in satisfactory performance, Sanjay complained of her missing her and began being hostile to her, picking on her and demeaning her and that he even encouraged some staff of Asian origin to demean her. It is also her averment that around November 2018, Sanjay called her to his office and told her to tell the Petitioner to resign because she was pregnant and not effective, that the Petitioner should go and raise her family and that \"jobs will always be there\". She further depones that this was not the only pregnant female being mistreated by the company as there was another employee named Grace Owour who received half pay during her maternity leave which started in November. She confirms that the Petitioner refused to resign as she was still meeting her performance obligations and there were no performance evaluations done to show that she was not performing. That following frustrations, interference and micromanagement in the execution of her HR functions, she resigned in November 2018 and also because the company was not interested in following the law which became a source of conflict every time she insisted they follow the law.",
            "6. The case was to be determined on the basis of pleadings, affidavits and documents filed by the parties. Neither the Petitioner nor the Respondent filed submissions as directed by the Court on 4th October 2021. Be that as it may, the Court renders its verdict. The Petitioner asserts mistreatment by the Respondent’s officials when she got pregnant. The Petitioner asserts that the Respondent’s managers were hostile to her and constantly accused her of non-performance. She also experienced unnecessary salary deductions and was forced to forfeit many leave days and that the Respondent then began to pressure her to resign and further put pressure on the HR Manager to sack her for being expensive to keep. Her dignity was constantly under attack during the monthly meetings where she would receive a thorough dress down from the Country Director on allegations of non-performance. The Petitioner contends that she was entitled to a medical cover under her contract of service but incurred a lot of medical expenses and missed several doctor’s appointments since the Respondent did not provide the said cover. To make things worse, when she returned from her maternity leave in September 2019, the Petitioner was immediately asked to resign and when she refused to do so, was summarily dismissed on 16th September 2019.",
            "7. Yet again we have a misogynistic employer who makes life miserable for female employees when they fall pregnant. The affidavit by the former HR Manager of the Respondent Miss Beth Murugi Wambugu is quite telling. As a HR manager she tried to guide the Respondent to proper HR practice but the Respondent was having none of it. The Respondent repeatedly contravened Article 27 of the Constitution which prohibits discrimination on any ground including pregnancy. To boot, the Respondent breached Article 28 with elan. Article 28 provides the right of every person to inherent dignity and to have that dignity respected and protected. As an employer it miserably failed to protect its female employees and as a consequence also breached Article 47 which protects the right to fair administrative action. The Respondent being guilty of these infarctions against the supreme law of the land must suffer sanctions. I hereby enter judgment for Petitioner as against the Respondent as follows:-",
            "1) A declaration do and is hereby issued that the Respondent violated the rights of the Petitioner under Articles 27, 28 and 47 of the Constitution.",
            "2) A declaration do and is hereby issued that the Respondent breached the Contract of Employment by failure to provide a medical cover for the Petitioner.",
            "3) The Respondent do pay the Petitioner the sum of Kshs, 1,000,000/- for the breach of Articles 27, 28 and 47 of the Constitution of Kenya.",
            "4) The Respondent do pay 3 months salary as compensation for the unlawful dismissal from employment – Kshs. 330,000/-",
            "5) Costs of the suit.",
            "6) Interest on the sums in 3 and 4 above at Court rates from the date of judgment till payment in full.",
            "It is so ordered.",

It is alleged that on the 6th day of November 2016 at Siyabei area in Narok North sub- county within Narok county, jointly before court broke and entered the dwelling house of Thomson Kipapei with intent to steal therein and did steal therein one sony television, one gas cylinder, one camera, one nokia mobile phone, assorted clothes and one radio face all valued at Kshs. 70,000/= the property of the said Thomson Kipapei.",

            "i. The Appellant stated that he pleaded not guilty.",
            "ii. That the trial magistrate erred in law and facts by convicting the appellant and failed to note that there were no stolen item that connected the appellant with the present case.",
            "iii. That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact when she relied with witnesses’ evidence and failed to consider that it was full of contradictory and uncorroborated.",
            "iv. That the learned trial magistrate erred on matters of law and fact by not considering that the possession availed by the prosecution was not connected with the appellant in any way.",

            "ix. That he prays to be supplied with the trial court proceedings and its judgment to enable him adduces better grounds of appeal.",
            "5. Ultimately, he prayed that this appeal be allowed; conviction and sentence be set aside and quashed, and an order for re trial.  ",
            "6. On 19/04/2021 the Appellant orally submitted to this court that his only prayer before this court is for time spent in prison to be taken into account.",
            "Respondent’s submission",
            "7. Ms. Torosi, the prosecution counsel, submitted for the state that, it is not true the there was no stolen item that connected him to the offence committed. On the material date, complainant and his family had gone to church and upon return he found his house broken and property stolen. The complainant got friends comprising of church members to track the foot marks of the suspects, tracking their shoes, boots and rubbers. The tracks led them to a forest where they found an equity card and in that location the stolen TV set 32 inch was recovered. An ambush was laid for whoever was to come and pick the TV as it appeared hidden. The complainant left the group guarding the place at about 7.00p.m. The appellant was arrested.",
            "8. PW3 corroborated PW1 and PW2 and that there was not contradictions at all in their testimony. PW3 corroborated PW1 and PW2 who participated in the arrest of the appellant who had gone to the place where the stolen TV set was hidden.PW2 corroborated PW1 and stated that they laid ambush where they found the stolen television set. That they were able to arrest the appellant who had come aboard a motorcycle and headed to the place where the TV set was.",
            "9. The appellant was connected to the offence committed as he went back for the things he had stolen and hidden but was arrested in the process by PW2 and PW3.",
            "10. There was no case of mistaken identity or frame up against the appellant. Prosecution witnesses denied that the appellant was a mere road user. They said he was with other two people, Cyrus Maina who was arrested with him but attempted to escape on a motorbike and Sururu who fled. The appellant was found in the company of Sururu who was a very positive connection to the house of PW1, the complainant. Sururu had worked for the complainant. It was not a mere coincidence that the house of PW1 had been broken into and the appellant and Sururu were using that road at about the same time.",
            "11. The sentence meted on the appellant by the trial magistrate court was legal and in accordance with the law.",
            "12. The defence of the appellant did not challenge the prosecution’s evidence.",
            "13. The counsel for the Respondent submitted that the conviction and sentence was safe as against the Appellant and urged the court uphold it.",
            "ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION",
            "Court’s duty",
            "14.  As first appellate court; I should re-evaluate the evidence afresh and arrive at own independent conclusions. I should however bear in mind that I neither saw nor heard the witnesses. See Njoroge v Republic (1987) KLR, 19 & Okeno v Republic (1972) E.A, 32.",
            "15. I have carefully considering the submissions of the respective parties and the record of appeal, as well as the oral submission by the appellant to the effect that he has only one prayer before this court that he wishes to pursue, to wit, time spent in custody to be taken into account in the sentence. Accordingly, the main issue left for this court to consider is:",
            "i. Whether the time spent was taken into account by the trial court. This is an essential element in sentencing as it prevents imposition of more severe sentence. ",
            "16. The appellant seeks to avail himself the benefit of time spent in custody prior to conviction under Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code; the section provides that: -",
            "“Subject to the provisions of section 38 of the Penal Code (Cap. 63) Every sentence shall be deemed to commence from, and to include the whole of the day of, the date on which it was pronounced, except where otherwise provided in this Code.",
            "Provided that where the person sentenced under subsection (1) has, prior to such sentence, been held in custody, the sentence shall take account of the period spent in custody (emphasis mine).”",
            "17. Court’s duty under section 333(2) of the CPC has been further explained in the Judiciary Sentencing Policy Guidelines (under clauses 7.10 and 7.11) thus:",
            "“The provision to section 333 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code obligates the court to take into account the time already served in custody if the convicted person had been in custody during the trial. Failure to do so impacts on the overall period of detention which may result in an excessive punishment that is not proportional to the offence committed. In determining the period of imprisonment that should be served by an offender, the court must take into account the period in which the offender was held in custody during the trial.”",
            "18. Of section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the Court of Appeal in Ahamad Abolfathi Mohammed & Another vs. Republic [2018] eKLR. (See also Bethwel Wilson Kibor vs. Republic [2009] eKLR) was categorical that court should give real effect to the said provision.",
            "19. In my understanding, the requirements in Section 333(2) of the CPC pertains to fair trial and justice; ensures that a person gets appropriate sentence. Thus, non-adherence with the section may result into the person serving a more severe sentence than is required in law; such sentence is illegal and not consistent with the right to a less severe sentence enshrined in Article 50 (2)(p) of the Constitution.",
            "20. Similarly, failure to give full effect to section 333(2) of the CPC rattles the right to protection and benefit of law guaranteed under Article 27(1) & (2) of the Constitution which provides that:",
            "(1) Every person is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection and equal benefit of the law.",
            "(2) Equality includes the full and equal enjoyment of all rights and fundamental freedoms. [Underlining mine]",
            "21. Daringly stated, a sentence that does not give any effect to Section 333(2) of the CPC leaves the period served in custody unaccounted for, thus, a deprivation of freedom arbitrarily or without a just cause contrary to Article 29(a) of the Constitution which provides that:",
            "Every person has the right to freedom and security of the person, which includes the right not to be—",
            "(a) deprived of freedom arbitrarily or without just cause;",
            "22. This school of thought bases its arguments on rights, and posits that non-adherence with Section 333(2) of the CPC may found a cause of action under Article 23(1) of the Constitution which provides that",
            "The High Court has jurisdiction, in accordance with Article 165, to hear and determine applications for redress of a denial, violation or infringement of, or threat to, a right or fundamental freedom in the Bill of Rights.",
            "23. For completeness of the argument, Article 165(3)(b) of the Constitution provides that:",
            "Subject to clause (5), the High Court shall have—",
            "(b) jurisdiction to determine the question whether a right or fundamental freedom in the Bill of Rights has been denied, violated, infringed or threatened;",
            "24. Accordingly, the instant application deserves evaluation by the court in so far as time spent in custody is concerned. From the record, the appellant was arraigned in court on 8/11/2016. He however, escaped prison and was re-arrested and produced in court on 20/11/2017. His conviction was 5/07/2018.",
            "25. In the upshot, the sentence herein shall run from the date of his re- arrest and production in court on 20/11/2017.",

            "(Being an appeal against the judgment and decree",
            "delivered by Hon. D.O. Mbeja (Mr.) (Senior Resident ",
            "Magistrate) on 24th April, 2020 in Milimani CMCC no. 7245 of 2015)",
            "JUDGMENT",
            "1. The respondent in this instance lodged a suit against the appellant and sought for reliefs namely a permanent injunction; a refund of the sum of Kshs.300,000/= and an order lifting the name of the respondent from the Credit Reference Bureau (CRB) Blacklist, together costs of the suit and interest thereon.",
            "2. The respondent pleaded in his plaint that on 17th August, 2012 he had entered into a sale agreement with one Daniel Amisi Omambia (“the third party”) for the purchase of the motor vehicle registration number KBQ 213A (“the subject motor vehicle”) at the purchase price of Kshs.3,850,000/=.",
            "3. The respondent pleaded that he paid the deposit sum of Kshs.1,540,000/= towards the aforementioned purchase and took out a loan facility with the appellant through its Ongata Rongai branch in order to pay the balance of Kshs.2,310,000/=.",
            "4. It was pleaded in the plaint that the respondent was able to repay the loan sum of Kshs.600,000/= leaving an outstanding balance of Kshs.1,700,000/= which he was unable to repay due to financial constraints.",
            "5. It was further pleaded in the plaint that consequently, the subject motor vehicle was repossessed by the appellant and sold by way of a public auction which the respondent alleges to have been irregular and illegal.",
            "6. The respondent pleaded that whereas the appellant managed to recover the sum of Kshs.2,000,000/= out of the aforesaid sale, it continued to claim an outstanding sum of over Kshs.1,500,000/= and went ahead to submit the name of the respondent for blacklisting with CRB.",
            "7. The respondent therefore sought inter alia, for the recovery of the sum of Kshs.300,000/= being the sum recovered by the appellant from the sale of the subject motor vehicle over and above the outstanding loan amount owed by the respondent.",
            "8. Upon entering appearance, the appellant filed its statement of defence to deny the allegations set out in the plaint.",
            "9. At the hearing of the suit, the respondent testified while the appellant relied on the testimony of one (1) witness.",
            "10. Upon close of submissions, the trial court granted the reliefs sought in the respondent’s plaint in its judgment delivered on 24th April, 2020.",
            "11. The appellant has now sought to challenge the aforementioned judgment on appeal and has put forward seven (7) grounds of appeal as seen in the memorandum of appeal dated 6th November, 2020:",
            "i. THAT the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in issuing a permanent injunction against the appellant from recovery of loan arrears from the respondent. ",
            "ii. THAT the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in assessing the sum of Kshs.300,000/ as a sum refundable to the respondent.  ",
            "iii. THAT the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in ordering that the respondent’s name should be lifted from the Credit Reference Bureau.",
            "iv. THAT the learned trial magistrate erred in law in failing to find that the respondent was still in debt to the appellant.",
            "v. THAT the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in finding that the respondent had proved his case on a balance of probabilities.",
            "vi. THAT the learned trial magistrate erred in law and departed and/or ignored the decided authorities relied upon by the appellant without justification.",
            "vii. THAT the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in not considering the submissions and correspondence relied upon by the appellant on whether a sum was still owing to the appellant or not, and the prevailing factors thereto. ",
            "12. At the directions of the court, the parties put in written submissions on the appeal. The appellant on the one part submits that the trial court fell into error in finding that it was entitled to refund the respondent the sum of Kshs.300,000/= in the absence of proof of the same.",
            "13. The appellant further submits that the respondent continues to be indebted to it in the sum of Kshs.1,564,981.25 and yet the trial court issued a permanent injunction restraining it from recovering the aforementioned sum from the respondent.",
            "14. It is also the contention of the appellant that since the respondent had not repaid the full loan amount, it was proper to have his name listed with CRB and hence the trial court ought not to have ordered for the lifting of the respondent’s name until the outstanding loan amount was paid in full.",
            "15. The respondent on the other part argues that the subject motor vehicle was sold for the sum of Kshs.2,290,000/= and yet the appellant failed to inform him of such sale until two (2) years later, and which sum was well over and above the outstanding loan amount owed by the respondent.",
            "16. The respondent therefore argues that the appellant had no basis for demanding any additional sums from him or continuing to have his name listed with CRB as a loan defaulter.",
            "17. It is also the submission of the respondent that out of the sum recovered from the sale of the subject motor vehicle, he was entitled to a refund which explains the order sought and granted by the trial court to that effect.",
            "18. The respondent contends that there was equally no basis for his name to continually to be listed with CRB and hence the issuance of the permanent injunction by the trial court.",
            "19. The respondent similarly contends that the consent entered into between the appellant and NIC Bank in respect to the sale of the subject motor vehicle and which consent was filed in a separate case does not have any binding effect upon the respondent, who was not a party thereto, and relies on the case of James Muchori Maina v Kenya Power & Lighting Company Ltd [2005] eKLR where the court determined that a consent only binds the parties thereto.",
            "20. I have considered the contending written submissions on appeal together with the few authorities cited in support thereof. I have also re-evaluated the evidence which the trial court had the opportunity to look at.",
            "21. Before I consider the merits of the appeal, I observed that the respondent sought to have the appeal dismissed on the basis that the appellant filed its record of appeal outside the timelines directed by the court.",
            "22. Upon my perusal of the record, I note that the above issue was raised at the point of final submissions and not at the preliminary stages of the appeal.",
            "23. Suffice it to say that under the provisions of Section 95 of theCivil Procedure Act and Order 50, Rule 5 of the Civil Procedure Rules, the courts have power to enlarge the time required for the performance of any act under the Rules even where such time has expired. On that basis and in the interest of substantive justice, I will therefore consider the merits of the appeal rather than to dismiss it at this stage.",
            "24. It is clear that the appeal lies fundamentally against the decision by the trial court to grant the reliefs sought in the plaint. I will therefore address the seven (7) grounds of appeal under the two (2) limbs hereunder.",
            "25. The first limb of the appeal concerns itself with whether the learned trial magistrate arrived at a proper finding that the respondent had proved his case against the appellant.",
            "26. Upon adopting his executed witness statement as evidence, the respondent who was PW1 stated that the third party sold the subject motor vehicle to him in the year 2012 for a total sum of Kshs.3,850,000/= out of which he paid a deposit in the sum of Kshs.1,500,000/= and took out a loan with the appellant for the balance of approximately Kshs.2,310,000/=.",
            "27. The respondent stated that he was only able to repay part of the loan sum, leaving an outstanding balance of approximately Kshs.1,700,000/= thereby resulting in the sale of the subject motor vehicle at a consideration of Kshs.2,290,000/=the details of which were not disclosed to him until much later.",
            "28. The respondent testified that consequently, he did not have anyoutstanding loan arrears with the appellant.",
            "29. In cross-examination, it was the evidence of the respondent that at the time of purchasing the subject motor vehicle, he and the appellant had undertaken a search thereon and that he had no knowledge of a separate loan owed by the third party to NIC Bank.",
            "30. It was also the evidence of the respondent that he later received communication from the appellant to the effect that he owed some money.",
            "31. In re-examination, the respondent stated that upon repossessing the subject motor vehicle in 2013, the appellant kept him in the dark over the status of the sale despite him following up on the same.",
            "32. Luke Ikigu (DW1) stated that he was at the time a Branch Manager at the appellant’s Ongata Rongai Branch produced the court order dated 29th May, 2014 in Milimani CMCC no. 4626 of 2013 as D. Exh 1.",
            "33. In cross-examination, the witness testified that at the time the parties herein entered into the loan agreement, he had not joined the Branch and that he had no evidence to show that the respondent was notified of the sale of the subject motor vehicle.",
            "34. It was the evidence of DW1 that the offer price for the subject motor vehicle was in the sum of Kshs.2,290,000/ and that only part of the sale proceeds to the subject motor vehicle were made to the appellant.",
            "35. In re-examination, the witness stated inter alia, that the respondent was not a party to Milimani CMCC no. 4626 of 2013 and that the appellant was under no obligation to notify the respondent of the sale upon repossession of the subject motor vehicle unless there is a deficit.",
            "36. The learned trial magistrate reasoned that the appellant ought to have informed the respondent of the proceeds of sale and accounts taken but did not, thereby resulting in a breach of the duty of care owed by the appellant to the respondent. Consequently, the learned trial magistrate arrived at the finding that the respondent had proved his case against the appellant on a balance of probabilities.",
            "37. Upon my re-examination of the pleadings, material and evidence on record, I note that it is not in dispute that the parties herein at all material times enjoyed a bank-customer relationship in which the appellant advanced the sum of Kshs.2,310,000/= to the respondent towards the purchase of the subject motor vehicle and subsequently, the subject motor vehicle was registered in the joint names of the parties herein.",
            "38. It is also not in dispute that the respondent did not repay the full loan amount thereby resulting in the repossession and sale of the subject motor vehicle by way of a public auction.",
            "39. A copy of the respondent’s loan statement which was adduced as evidence shows that as at 24th July, 2013 preceding the sale of the subject motor vehicle, the outstanding loan balance stood at Kshs.1,626,527.95 which supports the averments made by the respondent.",
            "40. Going by the evidence adduced, Milimani CMCC no. 4626 of 2013 was filed by NIC Bank against the appellant and other parties not before this court in respect to the subject motor vehicle and the court order issued on 29th May, 2014 shows that a consent order was made to the effect that inter alia, the proceeds of the sale be shared equally between NIC Bank and the appellant. It is clear that the respondent was not a party to that suit.",
            "41. From my re-examination of the evidence, it is apparent that an offer was made in respect to the subsequent sale of the subject motor vehicle in the sum of Kshs.2,290,000/= though it remains unclear whether this amounted to the final offer made. It is also apparent from the evidence that whereas DW1 could not ascertain the exact sum realized from such sale, the appellant received three (3) cheques totaling the sum of Kshs.2,140,000/=.",
            "42. In view of the foregoing and in the absence of any credible evidence to convince me otherwise, I find the position taken by the respondent to be more plausible than that taken by the appellant; that the latter was able to recover a sum from the sale which exceeded the outstanding loan amount owing from the former.",
            "43. For those reasons, I support the finding of the learned trial magistrate that the respondent had proved his case to the required standard.",
            "44. Further to the above, upon my perusal of the impugned decision, there is nothing to indicate that the learned trial magistrate overlooked the appellant’s evidence or submissions together with the authorities cited.",
            "45. This brings me to the second limb of the appeal touching on whether the respondent was entitled to the reliefs sought in his plaint and granted by the learned trial magistrate.",
            "46. Concerning the permanent injunction sought, upon my finding above that the appellant was able to recover the outstanding loan sum owed by the respondent out of the proceeds of the sale I am of the view that the appellant had no basis for demanding any additional sums from the respondent arising out of the loan facility.",
            "47. Consequently, I find that the learned trial magistrate acted correctly in issuing a permanent injunction against the appellant, restraining it from recovering the alleged loan arrears from the respondent.",
            "48. In respect to the order for refund of the sum of Kshs.300,000/= the evidence tendered; as noted above; shows that the sums recovered from the proceeds of sale of the subject motor vehicle exceeded the outstanding loan amount.",
            "49. The respondent brought credible evidence to support the aforementioned sum sought and hence I am satisfied that the learned trial magistrate was justified in awarding the same.",
            "50. The final substantive relief sought was for the delisting of the respondent from CRB as a loan defaulter. In view of the foregoing circumstances and upon my concurrence with the decision of the learned trial magistrate, I am convinced that there was no basis for the name of the respondent to continue being blacklisted.",
            "51. The upshot therefore is that the appeal is hereby dismissed for want of merit with costs to the respondent.",

            "RULING",
            "1. The appellant seeks stay of execution pending hearing and determination of this appeal. The application is supported by a sworn affidavit of Caroline Gathoni Makumi.",
            "2. The reasons given are that there is an intended eviction, there will be substantial loss if the house is destroyed, the appeal is meritorious, the subject land is the only known homestead.",
            "3. The respondent has opposed through a replying affidavit sworn on 16.3.2020 by Gerald Mutai M’Arimi.",
            "4. Firstly, the respondent states he bought the suit land on 22.11.2012 from the 1st appellant who has refused to transfer it to him and, the case has been delayed in the court for over 6 years one way or the other by the applicants; he is entitled to enjoy fruits of his judgment, has suffered a lot and if the orders are granted his suffering shall increase. He urges the court to dismiss the application.",
            "5. Order 42 rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules provides an order for stay shall not be made unless there is proof of substantial loss, there is no unreasonable delay in applying for the stay, and an offer for security for the due performance of the decree is proposed.",
            "6. In James Wangalwa & Another –vs- Agnes Naliaka Cheseto [2012] eKLR the court held an execution is a lawful process hence it cannot be said to be a substantial loss. Further the court went on to state, an applicant must show other factors which indicate the execution will create a state of affairs that will irreparably affect or negate the very essential core of the appeal.",
            "7. The essence of stay of execution is aimed at preserving the subject matter in dispute so that the rights of the appellant who is exercising the undoubted right of appeal, if successful, is not rendered nugatory. See RWW –vs- EKW [2019] eKLR. The court must also balance the interest of the appellant with those of the respondent.",
            "8. In the instant case, the judgment was delivered on 22.1.2020. The appeal was lodged on 20.2.2020 together with this application. It is therefore my finding that the appellant moved the court within reasonable time for stay.",
            "9. Coming to the issue of the nature of the decree issued, the appellant has not attached a copy of the decree or the judgment appealed against. The court is therefore unable to assess the nature of the pleadings, evidence, findings and the conclusion arrived at by the trial court so as to know the background of this appeal.",
            "10. Further the appellant alleges there is an impending eviction and or destruction of his homestead. It is not indicated if the appellant has been served with a notice of eviction.",
            "11. On the issue of substantial loss, the appellant has not demonstrated the loss he is likely to suffer. The respondent has expressly stated the 1st appellant took away his money Kshs. 250,000/= with effect 22.11.2012, yet he has declined to refund the same and or transfer the land. Similarly the appellant has made no proposal to deposit the said monies in court as security.",
            "12. In my considered view, the respondent has suffered a lot so far and he is likely to be prejudiced more if the orders of stay are issued.",
            "13. In Charles Wahome Gethi –vs- Angela Wairimu Gethi [2008] eKL, the Court of Appeal held:",
            "“ ……. It is not enough for the applicants to say that they live or reside on the suit land and that they will suffer substantial loss. The applicant must go further and show the substantial loss that the applicant stands to suffer if the respondent execute the decree in this suit against them.”",
            "14. In sum, I find the appellant has failed to meet the threshold under Order 42 rule 6. The application is dismissed with costs.",

            "RULING",
            "1. The plaintiffs seeks temporary orders of injunction, eviction and a permanent injunction restraining the defendants from trespassing, claiming, putting up structures and or interfering with the L.R No.Ntima/Igoki/7322.",
            "2. The application is supported by an affidavit sworn on 16.6.2021. She avers there was Nyeri Civil application No. 83 of 2019 decided in their favour and in which the defendants have disobeyed by invading their land, putting up buildings and denying them entry and access. The court is urged to step in and stop the aforesaid acts.",
            "3. The application is opposed through replying affidavits sworn by the 2nd defendant and Joshua Ngatu interested party on 13.8.2021 and 23.9. 2021 respectively.",
            "4. The gist of the 2nd defendant’s opposition is that after the suit was filed seeking adverse possession on Parcel 3117 parties attempted alternative dispute resolution, leading to an agreement to subdivide the Parcel into P/N 7321 and 7322 in favour of 5th defendant and the plaintiffs respectively. Further the defendants allege the Nyeri case was brought by a non-party to this suit who is the purported intended interested party.",
            "5. Additionally the respondents maintain a ruling was delivered in this case on 28.11.2010 marking the matter as closed hence the plaintiffs are through this application seeking to revive a closed matter out of dishonesty, malice and abuse of the court process.",
            "6. Regarding the interested party, it is submitted he is the only occupant in the premises, the 1st, 4th and 5th plaintiffs are dead, the Nyeri matter is still alive, an order for eviction has no basis, and applicants should await the outcome of the Nyeri appeal.",
            "7. The parties by consent agreed to compromise their application through the filing of written submissions dated 28.10.2021 for the applicant, 25.10.2021 for the respondents and 28.10.2021 for the interested party respectively.",
            "8. On the part of the applicants, they admit the contents of the 2nd defendant’s replying affidavit as regards a settlement and the resultant subdivisions and registration. However their point of departure is the respondents are moving into Parcel No. 7322 instead of Parcel No. 7321 as agreed, while the interested parties had allegedly sold partially Parcel No. 3117, upon learning of the settlement he sued them in Meru ELC 15 of 2018 which was dismissed on 20.2.2021 leading to the appeal in the Court of Appeal Nyeri where no stay has been granted. The court is urged to grant the orders sought so that the applicants can enjoy quiet possession of their land.",
            "9. The 2nd respondent submits they were not party to the Nyeri Matter and nor was the interested party, involved in the instant suit.",
            "10. Secondly it is submitted the applicants have not come to court in good faith but out of spite, malice, greed and through circumventing the law. The court is urged to dismiss the application as an abuse of the court process.",
            "11. The interested party submits the application is vexatious, misleading, frivolous and based on falsehoods. The court is asked to be guided by Kenleb Construction Ltd –vs- New Gatitu Service Station & Another [1990] eKLR on non-disclosure of material facts, Paul Gitonga Wanjau –vs- Gathuthi Tea Factory Co. Ltd. & 2 Others[2016] eKLR on the balance of convenience and Thathy –vs- Middle East Bank (K) Ltd [2003] 1KLR 595.",
            "HISTORY OF THE MATTER",
            "12. Through an originating summons dated 28.11.2007 the plaintiffs sought for declaratory orders against the defendants for adverse possession of 1.70 acres out of Parcel No. Ntima/Igoki/3717. The originating summons was supported by the affidavit of the 2nd plaintiff sworn on 28.11.2007. Following no-appearance, interlocutory judgment was entered on 2.4.2008.",
            "13. By a chamber summons dated 29.4.2008, one Joshua Ngatu sought to be enjoined as a party but the application was never prosecuted. Similarly the originating summons was amended on 11.7.2012 to include a 5th defendant who replied to the amended originating summons on 9.8.2012 claiming purchase is right over the Parcel No. 7321 from the 1-4 defendants.",
            "14. On 26.6.2014 the plaintiff filed list of witnesses and witness statements. No action was taken thereafter until the court issued a notice to show cause for 6.7.2015.",
            "15. On 24.1.2017 the interested party once again filed an application to be joined as an interested party. By a replying affidavit sworn on 13.7.2017 the 1st plaintiff admitted there had been a settlement in 2016 leading to a transfer of 1.1 acres by defendants in the names of 1st, 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs and a title deed issued on their favour on 8.6.2016. Similarly the 3rd defendant swore an affidavit on 6.3.2017 confirming settlement.",
            "16. By a ruling dated 18.4.2018, the court confirmed the settlement and the transfer of Parcel No. 7322 to the plaintiffs. It also rejected the interested party’s request to be enjoined as a party.",
            "17. The interested party came back by an application dated 10.7.2018 seeking for review of the orders made on 18.4.2018 to which the plaintiff and the defendants replied by affidavits sworn on 9 & 12.10.2018 respectively.",
            "18. In a ruling dated 28.11.2018, the court dismissed the application with costs and confirmed the file had been marked as settled on 25.5.2018 and once again directed the file be marked as closed.",
            "19. Without leave of the court the firm of Otieno & Co. advocates filed a notice of appointment dated 11.12.2018 and eventually filed a notice of appeal dated 7.12.2018 on 11.12.2018 sought for certified copies of proceedings and ruling of 28.11.2018.",
            "20. Another notice of appeal appears to have been filed on 21.12.2018 by the interested party. A copy of the order applied against was also issued on 14.3.2019.",
            "21. From the foregoing record it is clear no action was ever taken by any of the parties after 18.3.2019.",
            "22. Now coming to the application dated 16.6.2021, it is clear an order was made on 14.3.2019 that the suit was compromised and or settled as at 22.5.2018. Similarly, on 28.11.2018 the court for avoidance of any doubt marked the file closed. Even though the parties settled the matter through consent but did not file it in court for endorsement and eventual extraction of a decree, their intention was brought to the attention of the court and the matter marked as settled as they requested.",
            "23. The said intention was clearly implemented by issuance of title deeds in favour of the plaintiffs and the defendant herein. The record is clear Joshua Ngatu was never enjoined as a party in this suit. After all as at the time he sought to be joined the suit had been settled. He cannot therefore purport to participate in this matter through a back door. Further his advocates on record as indicated above came after the matter was settled and without leave of court. They are therefore improperly on record and hence strangers to this case for they cannot purport to represent a party whose application to be joined was rejected by the court.",
            "24. Consequently, the replying affidavit and submissions filed by Otieno C & Co. Advocates on behalf of Joshua Ngatu, from the court records are deemed filed by a stranger. They are hereby expunged from the record.",
            "25. Once a case is settled and a file closed the only way a party can approach court is through post judgment application as to execution.",
            "26. As indicated above, no decree has been extracted by the parties herein yet are now making accusations and counter-acquisitions. None of them brought before this court the consent for filing and endorsement. At their request the suit was marked as settled and file closed with no order as to costs.",
            "27. There is no application brought for execution in line with Order 22 of the Civil Procedure Rules and the Civil Procedure Act. If the parties reached an arbitral award again none was filed in accordance with Order 25, 35 & 46 of the Civil Procedure Act.",
            "28. In the premises it is my considered view that the application herein lacks merit. The same is dismissed with no order as to costs.",

            "(Being an appeal from the judgment and decree by Hon. C. M. Kamau, Senior Resident Magistrate ",
            "in Rongo Principal Magistrate's Court Civil Suit No. 60 of 2014 delivered on 04/03/2019)",
            "JUDGMENT",
            "1. The appeal subject of this judgment arose from the dismissal of the Appellant's suit by the trial court vide the judgment rendered on 04/03/2019. The suit was dismissed for want of proof.  ",
            "2. The Appellant herein, Mary Anyango Onyango, filed Rongo Principal Magistrate’s Court Civil Suit No. 60 of 2014 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the suit’) against the Respondent herein, South Nyanza Sugar Co. Ltd. The Appellant pleaded that by an Outgrowers Cane Agreement entered into on 27/11/2008 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Contract') the Respondent contracted the Appellant to grow and sell to it sugarcane at her parcel of land being Plot No. 1194 Field No. 26B measuring 0.4 Hectares in Kakmasia Sub-Location within Migori County.",
            "3. It was further pleaded that the Contract was for a period of five years or until one plant crop and two ratoon crops of the sugarcane were harvested from the subject parcel of land whichever event occurred first. The Appellant contended that she took good care of the plant crop until maturity but the Respondent failed to harvest the plant crop thereby compromising the development of the ratoon cane crops thereby resulting to loss of income. She sought for compensation for the loss of the three crop cycles at Kshs. 405, 000/= together with costs and interest at court rates.",
            "4. The Respondent entered appearance and filed a Statement of Defence dated 22/04/2015. It denied the contract and any breach thereof. It denied that the Appellant suffered any loss. The Appellant was put into strict proof thereof. The Respondent further pleaded that if at all the Appellant suffered any such loss then the Appellant was the author of her own misfortune in that she failed to properly maintain the sugar cane crops to the required standards or at all to warrant the same being harvested and milled as the same was uneconomical.",
            "5. The suit was finally settled down for hearing where both parties were represented by Counsels. The Appellant was the sole witness who testified and produced several exhibits and adopted her statement as part of her evidence. The Respondent was represented by its Senior Field Supervisor who testified as DW1 and adopted his statement as part of his evidence and also produced the documents in the List of Documents as exhibits. The court thereafter proceeded to render the judgment where it dismissed the suit with costs. It is that judgment which is the subject of this appeal.",
            "6. The Appellant in praying that the appeal be allowed and appropriate compensation be awarded proposed the following four grounds in the Memorandum of Appeal dated 18/03/2019 and filed in Court on 19/03/2019: -",
            "1. The learned magistrate erred in law and fact in entertaining matters / evidence of fact, adduced only at the trial by the defendant but which were never pleaded or ever formed part of the defence pleadings.",
            "2. The learned trial magistrate erred in law in giving weight to a so-called warning letter dated 20/5/2010, which letter was a fabrication, was never properly served and did not terminate the contract or constitute a waiver of liability attaching on the defendant.",
            "3. The trial magistrate exhibited extreme basis in the suit to the extent of posing his own view/versions of evidence as the defence evidence, and which evidence was non-existence at the trial or even in the defence case or submissions.",
            "4. The trial magistrate  erred in law in failing to award the appellant damages for breach when the evidence on record clearly showed that the defendant had failed to make any harvest  of the sugar cane on the ground, or absolve itself from the contract, by terminating the same.   ",
            "7. Directions were taken and the appeal was disposed of by way of written submissions where both parties duly complied. The Appellant referred to several decisions in support of the appeal.      ",
            "8. As the first appellate Court, the role of this Court is to revisit the evidence on record, evaluate it and reach its own conclusion in the matter. (See the case of Selle & Ano. vs. Associated Motor Boat Co. Ltd (1968) EA 123). This court nevertheless appreciates that an appellate Court will not ordinarily interfere with findings of fact by the trial Court unless they were based on no evidence at all, or on a misapprehension of it or the Court is shown demonstrably to have acted on wrong principles in reaching the findings.  This was the holding in Mwanasokoni – versus- Kenya Bus Service Ltd. (1982-88) 1 KAR 278 and Kiruga –versus- Kiruga & Another (1988) KLR 348).",
            "9. I have carefully perused and understood the contents of the pleadings, proceedings, judgment, grounds of appeal, submissions and the decisions referred to by the Appellant.",
            "10. The crux of the dismissal of the suit was that the Appellant did not call evidence to prove that she developed the cane and did not call the labourer to support her case. There was also the issue of sale of the cane crop to a jaggery and also the issue of the duty to harvest the cane. ",
            "11. I will begin with the issue of whether the Appellant actually developed the cane. DW1 testified before court. In his testimony DW1 stated that ‘there was a contract dated 27/11/2008. At the time we signed contract the cane was already planted. …. On 20/05/2010 the farmer deliberately decided to sell the cane to a jaggery dealer. The dealer planted his processing machine right in the cane plantation and the cane was … crushed to a jaggery. This is in contravention of clause 3.5 of the contract….’",
            "12. The evidence of DW1 settled the issue as to whether the cane was developed. There was no doubt that the cane was indeed developed upto maturity. The court therefore erred in not considering the evidence of DW1 on the development of the cane.",
            "13. There was the other issue that the Appellant had diverted her cane to a third party, a jaggery. DW1 so stated in his evidence. That is a strong position and if properly relied on is capable of dismissing a claimant’s claim.",
            "14. The Appellant’s response to the issue of selling the cane to a jaggery was that the issue was not correct, the issue was not pleaded by the Respondent in its statement of defence and that the Appellant was denied an opportunity to challenge that evidence before the trial court.",
            "15. It is true the Respondent did not plead that the Appellant instead sold the cane to a third party. At the risk of repetition, I have severally taken the legal position that in an adversarial system of litigation any evidence which does not support the pleadings is for rejection. That position was clearly emphasized by the Court of Appeal in Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & Ano. vs. Stephen Mutinda Mule & 3 others (2014) eKLR which cited with approval the decision of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in Adetoun Oladeji (NIG) vs. Nigeria Breweries PLC SC 91/2002 where Sylvester Umaru Onu, JSC stated that: -",
            "….It is settled law that it is not for the courts to make a case of its own or to formulate its own from the evidence before it and thereafter proceed to give a decision based upon its own postulation quite separate from the case the parties made before it…..",
            "It is settled law that parties are bound by their pleadings……the court below was in error when it raised the issue contrary to the pleadings of the parties.’",
            "16. Adereji, JSC in the same case expressed himself thus on the importance and place of pleadings: -",
            "…..it is now trite principle in law that parties are bound by their pleadings and that any evidence led by any of the parties which does not support the averments in the pleadings, or put in another way, which is at variance with the averments of the pleadings goes to no issue and must be disregarded……",
            "…In fact, that parties are not allowed to depart from their pleadings is on the authorities basic as this enables parties to prepare their evidence on the issues as joined and avoid any surprises by which no opportunity is given to the other party to meet the new situation.",
            "17. The Supreme Court as well added its voice on the legal position in a ruling in Raila Amolo Odinga & Another vs. IEBC & 2 others (2017) eKLR. ",
            "18. That being the legal position it therefore renders that the evidence at the trial to the extent that the Appellant sold the cane to a third party was at variance with the pleadings. That evidence cannot be legally acceptable as a basis for rejecting a claim.  The issue of selling the cane to a jaggery was a non-issue.",
            "19. I must however add that the Respondent may have had a good defence against the claim, but as said, it all depends on the pleadings. The Respondent did not even attempt any amendment to the pleadings. It was therefore bound by its pleadings.",
            "20. The Appellant adduced evidence and produced exhibits. I have weighed the respective parties’ evidence. My attention was drawn to the court’s finding on the alleged warning letter. The record has it that the court declined to accept the warning letter as an exhibit for want of earlier disclosure. That was on 23/01/2018. However, the court relied on the same warning letter in its judgment and found that ‘In support of this position, the defendant availed a warning letter issued to the farmer. It is dated May 2010.’",
            "21. The approach by the trial court on the warning letter was definitely wanting. A document which is not formally produced as an exhibit does not form the evidential record and cannot be a basis of a court’s finding. The Court of Appeal in Kenneth Nyaga Mwige v Austin Kiguta & 2 others (2015) eKLR clearly stated the correct legal position on production of exhibits and proof of the contents of those exhibits. The Court stated as follows: -",
            "18.    ………  Any document filed and/or marked for identification by either party, passes through three stages before it is held proved or disproved.  First, when the document is filed, the document though on file does not became part of the judicial record.  Second, when the documents are tendered or produced in evidence as an exhibit by either party and the court admits the documents in evidence, it becomes part of the judicial record of the case and constitutes evidence; mere admission of a document in evidence does not amount to its proof; admission of a document in evidence as an exhibit should not be confused with proof of the document.  Third, the document becomes proved, not or disproved when the court applies its judicial mind to determine the relevance and veracity of the contents- this is at the final hearing of the case.  When the court is called upon to examine the admissibility of a document, it concentrates only on the document.  When called upon to form a judicial opinion whether a document has been proved or disproved or not proved, the court would look not at the document alone but it would take into consideration all facts and evidence on record……. (emphasis added).",
            "22. There was as well the issue of the Appellant not availing the harvested cane to the Respondent. In other words, the Respondent contended that the duty to harvest the cane was on the Appellant.",
            "23. I have in previous decisions dealt with the duty to harvest mature cane in sugar contracts. In Migori High Court Civil Appeal No. 86 of 2016 Elena Olola vs. South Nyanza Sugar Co. Ltd (2018) eKLR I reiterated what I had earlier on held in Migori High Court Civil Appeal No. 41 of 2016 Jane Adhiambo Atinda vs. South Nyanza Sugar Co. Ltd (2017) eKLR as follows: -",
            "27.  Being alive ……",
            "                   18. That now brings me to the finding by the trial court that the Appellant failed to adhere to Clause 3.1.2 of the Contract in not harvesting and delivering the cane to the Respondent. A contract document must always be considered in its entirety. The good reason for that lies in the truism that clauses in a contract tend to complement one another and one risks not getting the whole intention of the parties if a consideration or reference is put on just a portion of the document. Had the learned trial court done so, it would have come across Clause 3.1.12 which requires the Miller (Respondent) to: -",
            "‘Prepare the harvesting program setting out the approximate expected time of harvesting which program will be subject to changes necessitated by factors beyond the control of the Miller.’",
            "                 19.      A look at Clauses 3.1.2 and 3.1.12 of the contract places a duty upon the Respondent before the actual harvesting of the cane. That duty is for the Respondent to ‘inspect the cane and determine its maturity and to prepare the harvesting program setting out the approximate expected time of harvesting’. There is no evidence that the Respondent discharged that contractual duty in the first instance. That failure, in the face of the fact that the cane had matured, can only mean that it is the Respondent who was in breach of the contract. With tremendous respect, the finding of the learned trial Magistrate that the Appellant failed to harvest and deliver the cane to the Respondent was not only unsupported by evidence but also arrived at without a full consideration of the contract and was therefore erroneous. That finding must be interfered with.",
            "28. Needless to say, there are several other clauses in the contract which when cumulatively taken buttress the position that the duty to harvest the cane is the Respondent’s. Further thereto, there is the Sugar Act (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’). This Act was the applicable law by the time the contract was entered. The Act stipulated under Section 6(a) of the Second Schedule thereof, which Schedule was a creation of Section 29 of the Act, that: -",
            "                        ‘The role of the miller is to -",
            "(a) Harvest, weigh at the farm gate, transport and mill the sugar cane supplied from the growers’ field and nucleus estate efficiently and make payments to the sugar cane growers as scheduled in the agreement.’ (emphasis added)",
            "29. The Act being an Act of Parliament went through all the stages of law-making until it became law in Kenya. The Act can only be subordinate to the Constitution and/or may in specific and clear instances be ousted by an express provision on another Act of Parliament. In this case there is an attempt by the contract to oust the provision of the Act. The contract is an agreement between the parties herein whereas the Act is an expression of the will of the people of Kenya through Parliament. The contract is hence subordinate to the statutory legislation. Any attempt by parties to an agreement to otherwise oust the provisions of an Act of Parliament can only be void and severable as far the attempt is concerned. The contract therefore offends the express provisions of the Act in respect to the duty to harvest the cane and as such it cannot stand in the face of the Act; it must give way to the Act. ",
            "24. I hence reiterate that the Respondent had the duty to harvest the cane at maturity under the contract in consideration. Having alleged that the Appellant sold the cane to a jaggery it then goes without say that the Respondent never harvested the cane.",
            "25. From the record the Appellant proved her case on a balance of probability. There was evidence that the Appellant developed the cane until it attained maturity, but the Respondent failed to harvest it. There was no meaningful opposition to the claim. The court therefore erred in not finding that the suit was proved in law. The Respondent was in breach of the contract for not harvesting the cane.",
            "26. That therefore leads this Court to the remedies for such a breach. Settled in law, remedies in breach of contracts claims must be specifically pleaded and proved. The intention of the remedies is that claimant must be put as far as possible in the same position he would have been if the breach complained of had not occurred (restitution in integrum’). The measure of such damages would naturally flow from the contract itself or as contemplated by the parties at the time the contract was made and that such damages are not at large but in the nature of special damages. (See the Court of Appeal in Kenya Industrial Estates Ltd v Lee Enterprises Ltd NRB CA Civil Appeal No. 54 of 2004 [2009] eKLR, Kenya Breweries Ltd v Natex Distributors Ltd Milimani HCCC No. 704 of 2000 [2004] eKLR), Joseph Urigadi Kedeva vs. Ebby Kangishal Kavai Kisumu Civil Appeal No. 239 of 1997 (UR) among others).",
            "27. Like any other disputes based on breach of contracts, such disputes must be weighed against the settled principles of remoteness, causation and mitigation. In Migori High Court Civil Appeal No. 74 of 2018 South Nyanza Sugar Co. Ltd vs. Rehema Joseph Nkonya (unreported) I dealt with the applicability of the principle of mitigation in sugar disputes. I rendered myself thus: -",
            "18. On the resultant remedy for the breach I have previously held in Migori High Court Civil Appeal No. 10 of 2016 South Nyanza Sugar Co. Ltd vs. Joseph O. Onyango (2017) eKLR that once a farmer proves that the Miller failed to harvest the plant crop at maturity then the farmer is entitled to the proceeds of the plant crop as well as the ratoon crops subject to the pleadings. Equally, when a Miller fails to harvest the first ratoon crop then the farmer is entitled to compensation for the first and second ratoon crops subject to the contract. In this case the Respondent was entitled to the proceeds of the plant crop and the first ratoon crop yields since the pleadings claim as such.",
            "19. Closely related to the aspect of remedy is the issue of mitigation of loss. The issue is one which is hotly contested almost in every appeal and is pending determination at the Court of Appeal. There are divergent views by the High Court on the issue. ",
            "28. I must certainly affirm the position that disputes based on breach of contracts are subject to the principles of remoteness, causation and mitigation. I further agree with the Court of Appeal in several decisions that a party alleging breach of contract must take steps to mitigate loss (See African Highland Produce Limited vs. John Kisorio (2001) eKLR). ",
            "29. The question which now arises is how should a Defendant handle the issue of mitigation of loss in a suit where the Plaintiff did not plead how it/he/she mitigated the loss? That question is factual. To me, the burden rests upon the Defendant to demonstrate how the Plaintiff ought to have mitigated the loss. Such approach must first find its basis in the pleadings. By doing so the Plaintiff would be put in sufficient notice and accorded an opportunity to challenge the evidence on mitigation of loss if need be. That is the essence of a fair trial in Article 50(1) of the Constitution. ",
            "30. A defendant should not raise the issue of mitigation of loss on appeal at the first instance. By doing so, the issue becomes a non-issue. The issue must be pleaded and proved. (See the Supreme Court ruling in Raila Amolo Odinga & Another vs. IEBC & 2 others (2017) eKLR and the Court of Appeal in The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & Ano. vs. Stephen Mutinda Mule & 3 others (2014) eKLR). ",
            "31. I have consciously taken the foregone position on the understanding that contracts are between parties and each contract must be independently scrutinized as there may be some instances where the principle of mitigation of loss may reasonably not be applicable in a dispute more so depending on the terms of such a contract.  ",
            "32. The foregone has been echoed by some Courts. Majanja, J. in Kisii High Court Civil Appeal No. 60 of 2017 South Nyanza Sugar Co. Ltd vs. Donald Ochieng Mideny (2018) eKLR when he recently (on 21/12/2018) rendered himself on the issue after considering several past decisions including some by yours truly and held that: -  ",
            "                   15. Mitigation of damages is not a question of law, but one of fact dependent on the circumstances of each particular case, the burden of proof being on the defendant (See African Highland Produce Limited vs. Kisorio (1999) LLR 1461 (CAK). Since the appellant did not contest the respondent’s claim, it did not show how the respondent could mitigate the loss.",
            "             16. The appellant’s arguments in support of the appeal were attractive but at the end of the day the respondent’s case before the trial court was not contested and for this reason, I dismiss the appeal……  ",
            "33. In this case the issue of mitigation of loss was not pleaded by the Appellant in the statement of defence. Instead, the Appellant denied the existence of the contract. The Appellant only pleaded in the alternative that upon proof of the contract then the Respondent failed to exercise diligence in growing the cane. The Appellant unfortunately did not lead any evidence on the position. There was no mention of the issue of mitigation of loss or at all. How then was the Respondent expected to respond to a non-issue? ",
            "34. I therefore find and hold that the issue of mitigation of loss having not been raised in the suit cannot be subject of an appeal. ",
            "20. The above position applies in this case. The principle of mitigation of loss does not come to the aid of the Respondent in this case. The Appellant was therefore entitled to compensation in respect to the three crop cycles.",
            "21. The Respondent in its submissions before this Court urged this Court to adopt the tonnage on plant crop at 66.56 tons per hectare and 48.76 tonnes per hectare on the ratoon crops. The Respondent further urged this Court to disregard the document produced by the Appellant on yields for want of authenticity. I have perused the document produced by the Appellant. I duly concur with the submission by the Respondent. I will hence be guided by the Respondent’s proposals on the yields.  ",
            "22. Given that the contract was entered in November 2008 then in line with Clause 1(f) thereof and by taking into account all the necessary deductions the Appellant was entitled to the net income of Kshs. 131,264/= on the three crop cycles.",
            "23. Following the foregone discourse, the upshot is that the following final orders do hereby issue: -",
            "a) The appeal hereby succeeds and the finding of the learned magistrate dismissing the suit with costs be and is hereby set aside accordingly;",
            "b) Judgment is hereby entered for the Appellant as against the Respondent for Kshs. 131,264/=.",
            "c) The sum of Kshs. 131,264/= shall attract interest at court rates from the date of filing of the Plaint;",
            "d) The Appellant shall have costs of the suit as well as costs of the appeal.",
            "Orders accordingly.",

            "Appellant": "George Musau Mwendwa",
            "Respondent": "Republic"
        },
        "judgement": [
            "1.George Musau Mwendwa, (the appellant) was charged with the offence of defilement in violation of section 8(1) as read with section 8(2) of the Sexual Offences Act. The particulars of the charge were that on diverse dates between 5th and 7th January 2011 in Narok North district within Rift valley province, he unlawfully and intentionally did cause his penis to penetrate the vagina of HM, a girl aged 11 years. In the alternative he was charged with the offence of indecent act with a child contrary to section 11(1) of the sexual offences Act. He pleaded not guilty of the main and the alternative charges.",
            "2.The trial proceeded with six (6) state witnesses lined up in support of the prosecution case. The child, who we shall refer to as HM (PW1), testified after a voir dire examination by the trial court. It was her evidence that she was 14 years old and was in standard 7 at [particulars withheld] Academy in Narok. On 5th January, 2011 at about 5. 00 p.m, she was sent by her aunt JKO (PW3) to the supermarket to buy stock for the aunt’s shop and some personal items for herself. She went to Kilungu supermarket where she met the accused, who assisted her to carry the items she had bought. She narrated how the appellant booked a hotel room where he took her and defiled her not once but severally and they kept changing hotels where the appellant would have intercourse with her. They stayed together at different hotel lodgings for a week after which the appellant tried to force her to board a vehicle to Kisii. While at the bus terminus, they were found by K (PW3) and the sister who were looking for her. The police were alerted, and the appellant was arrested. HM was taken to Narok District hospital where she was examined by Hillary Kiptoo (PW2), a clinical officer attached to the said hospital. The witness observed that the child had tender lower abdomen, her hymen was torn, the labia minora had bruises and there was a discharge and blood stain on the labia majora, a confirmation that the child had been defiled.",
            "3.JKO, (PW3) the child’s aunt who had sent her to the supermarket on the date in question, testified that, when the child failed to return home from the shop, she got worried and the next day she enquired from the child’s mother whether she was at home. On realization that the child had not returned home the previous day, the witness embarked on looking for her and also reported the matter to the police station. She had been informed that the appellant who worked as a security guard had been seen with her. Her search yielded results when she found the child at the bus terminus ready to board a matatu to Kisii. After he was arrested, the appellant is said to have taken the arresting officer, (PW5) to his house from where the items the child had bought from the supermarket were recovered.",
            "4.When placed on his defence, the appellant opted to give unsworn evidence and denied committing the offences he was charged with. He explained that he could not remember where he was on 5th November 2011, but that on 7th January, 2011 he was working at Seasons’ hotel on night shift when at 11.00 am on the same day he met people who identified themselves as police officers and asked him to accompany them to the police station. At the police station, he found two ladies and the child, who he said he did not know before. He stated that nothing was recovered from his house.",
            "5.In its judgment the trial court found that the prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt and convicted the appellant on the main charge of defilement contrary to section 8(1)(3) of the Sexual Offences Act since the complainant’s age was 14 years according to the assessment report and not 11 years as indicated in the charge sheet and sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment.",
            "6.Aggrieved by the decision of the trial court the appellant appealed against both conviction and sentence. The High Court (Emukule, J.) heard the appeal and, in a judgment delivered on 8th November, 2013 held that the prosecution had proved the charges against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt and dismissed the appeal in its entirety.",
            "7.Being further aggrieved, the appellant has now moved to this Court on second, and perhaps, last appeal. He has challenged the said judgment on grounds that the trial court erred by upholding the conviction and sentence with poor investigations; that the evidence on record was not evaluated; that the evidence on record was an afterthought; that the court convicted him in the absence of his defence witnesses; that the P3 form was inconsistent with the evidence of the clinical officer and that the prosecution had not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.When the appeal came up for virtual plenary hearing before us on 8th March 2021, the appellant appeared in person while the office of the DPP was represented by Miss. Chelagat, learned prosecution counsel. The appellant urged that his appeal be allowed. The appellant relied on his written submissions which were on record and urged the Court to allow the appeal and set him at liberty saying that he has stayed in prison for long time, and that he has learnt his lesson and also acquired some life skills which he can put to use outside prison.",
            "8.On her part, Miss Chelagat also relied on her submissions and urged the Court to confine itself to matters of law and not facts. She reminded the Court that severity of sentence is a question of fact, and that the Court should not, therefore, interfere with the sentence. She maintained that the P3 form showed that the victim’s vagina was inflamed, reddish and had mild laceration and a blood stained discharge; that the element of penetration had been proved; that the prosecution had proved all the ingredients of the offence of defilement; that the sentence imposed was legal; that the age of the minor had been proved to be 14 years as at the time of the commission of the offence and that the appellant was the perpetrator of the offence.",
            "9.This being a second appeal, we are enjoined by the provisions of section 361(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code to entertain only matters of law. In the case of Njoroge v Republic [1982] KLR 388, this principle was enunciated as follows;“On a second appeal, the Court of Appeal is only concerned with points of law. On such an appeal, the court was bound by the concurrent findings of fact made by the lower courts, unless these findings were shown not to be based on evidence.”Similarly, in Adan Muraguri Mungara v Republic [2010] eKLR, this Court reiterated the circumstances under which we may interfere with the concurrent findings of fact by the trial court and the first appellate court, as follows:“As this Court has stated many times before, it has a duty to pay homage to concurrent findings of fact made by the two courts below unless such findings are based on no evidence at all or on a perversion of the evidence, or unless on the totality of the evidence, no reasonable tribunal properly directing itself would arrive at such findings. That would mean that the decision is bad in law, thus entitling this Court to interfere.”We have perused the record of appeal, the written submissions and the oral highlights. The issues that arise for determination are: whether the prosecution proved penetration, and the age of the child; whether the appellant was properly identified as the offender and whether the evidence tendered proved the offence he was convicted of.",
            "10.This being a case of defilement three ingredients must be proved in order to sustain a conviction, as was held in George Opondo Olunga v Republic [2016] eKLR, they include: identification or recognition of the offender; penetration and the age of the victim. On the first issue, both courts below found that the child had been defiled. Her evidence was corroborated by that of the clinical officer who testified in court and produced the P3 form as an exhibit. No basis has been laid for us to interfere with the concurrent findings of fact by the two courts below on this point.",
            "11.On the issue of identification, HM properly identified the appellant as the person who defiled her. She said that she knew the appellant before as he used to buy items from her aunt’s shop and that he worked in a bar in town. The evidence was corroborated in material aspects by her aunt, who found that the appellant was working at Seasons Bar and that he had not reported on duty for three days. The appellant did not dispute that fact, but stated that he worked on night shift on the 5th January to 7th January 2011. We note that the appellant met the child at about 5.00 pm, which was in broad daylight. There was no evidence that the child was at all times blind-folded or that she could not identify the appellant for any other reason. Thus, the identification of the appellant as the perpetrator of the crime cannot be in doubt. Both courts below made concurrent findings of fact that the child properly identified the appellant. Again, we have no reason for interfering with that finding of fact.",
            "12.With regard to the age of the complainant, we agree that there could have been some discrepancy in the testimony of the child, her aunt and the P3 form. The age given by the witnesses was between 11 years and 14 years of age. Of importance, however, is the fact that the child was below 18 years old and the charge of defilement was therefore proved. Section 2 of the Sexual Offences Act defines a child as any person under the age of 18 years. The age of HM was established to be 14 years, which was important for purposes of sentencing. In Hadson Ali Mwachango v. Republic [2016] eKLR this court held as follows:“The importance of proving the age of a victim of defilement under the Sexual Offences Act by cogent evidence cannot be gainsaid. It is not in doubt that the age of the victim is an essential ingredient of the offence of defilement and forms an important part of the charge because the prescribed sentence is dependent on the age of victim. In Alfayo Gombe Okello v Republic Cr App No 203 of 2009 (Kisumu). This Court stated as follows;In its wisdom Parliament chose to categorize the gravity of that offence on the basis of the age of the victim, and consequently the age of the victim is a necessary ingredient of the offence which ought to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. That must be so because dire consequences flow from proof of the offence under section 8(1)?”",
            "13.As already stated, the appellant was charged with the offence of defilement and section 8(3) of the Sexual Offences Act, which was the Penal section in regard to the charge against the appellant provides:“A person who commits an offence of defilement with a child between the age of twelve and fifteen years is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than twenty years.” (Emphasis Added)",
            "14.The trial court sentenced the appellant to 20 years’ imprisonment, which is the sentence imposed for defilement of children between the ages of 12 and 14 years. The appellant was not in the circumstances prejudiced by the courts’ finding that the child was 14 years old. It would have been different had he been sentenced for defiling an 11 year old, as that would have taken him to a different sentence band, which would have attracted a more severe sentence. We find no reason to interfere with the sentence meted out by the trial Magistrate and upheld by the High Court. Accordingly, this appeal fails both on conviction and sentence and we dismiss it in its entirety."

            "1.Walter Ochieng’ Ogolo is charged with an offence of murder contrary to section 203 as read with section 204 of the Penal Code.",
            "2.The particulars of the offence are that on the 5th day of June, 2018, at Bassi village, Kasewe location, Rachuonyo East Sub County of Homa Bay County, murdered Wilson Ogoi Jalang’o.",
            "3.It was contended that the deceased referred to the accused as son of Owino, a title he detested, and this led him to attack the deceased. Owino had entered into a leviratic union with the mother of the accused after the death of his father.",
            "4.The accused in his defence contended that he did not know the cause of the death of the deceased.",
            "5.The issues for determination are:a.Whether the accused caused the death of the deceased or not; andb.Whether the offence of murder was proved.",
            "6.Robinson Hezron Jalang’o (PW1) the brother of the deceased was the only witness whose evidence linked the accused to the offence. A fact can be proved by the evidence of a single witness. The Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa in Abdalla Wendo v Republic [1953] 20 E.A.C.A 166 held on this issue as follows:Subject to certain exceptions, it is trite law that a fact may be proved by the testimony of a single witness but this does not lessen the need for testing with the greatest care the evidence of a single witness respecting identification, especially when it is known that the conditions favouring a correct identification, were difficult. In such circumstances what is needed is other evidence whether it be circumstantial or / direct, pointing to guilt, from which a judge or jury can reasonably conclude that the evidence of identification, although based on the testimony of a single witness, can safely be accepted as free from the possibility of error.In the instant case I will attempt to find if the evidence of PW1 can be a basis for conviction.",
            "7.Robinson Hezron Jalang’o (PW1) went to the scene after the fact. He was attracted by noises behind his house. This was at about 6.30 p.m. When he arrived at the scene, he found the deceased lying down and the accused on seeing him ran away. The evidence against the accused by this witness is circumstantial. In the case of Mohamed & 3 Others vs. Republic [2005]1 KLR 722  Osiemo Judge restated circumstantial evidence as follows:Circumstantial evidence means evidence that tends to prove a fact indirectly by proving other events or circumstances which afford a basis for reasonable inference of the occurrence of the fact at issue. The circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved.",
            "8.The evidence of PW1 is believable because of the following reasons:a.The accused was known to him since his (accused’s) childhood and there was no claim that the obtaining conditions at the time of the recognition were not favourable;b.The deceased told him that the accused attacked him after he had called him son of Owino; andc.There is no evidence on record as to why this witness would implicate the accused falsely.",
            "9.I therefore find that it was the accused who inflicted the fatal injuries to the deceased.",
            "10.For a conviction to be founded on the evidence on record, the prosecution must prove the existence of malice aforethought. In Black’s Law dictionary, 10th Edition malice aforethought is defined as:The requisite mental state for common-law murder, encompassing any one of the following (1) the intent to kill (2) the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm (3) extremely reckless difference to the value of human life (the so-called “abandoned and malignant heart”), or (4) the intent to commit a dangerous felony (which leads to culpability under the felony-murder rule).Section 206 of the Penal Code gives instances when malice aforethought may be proved. It provides:Malice aforethought shall be deemed to be established by evidence proving any one or more of the following circumstances—(a)an intention to cause the death of or to do grievous harm to any person, whether that person is the person actually killed or not;(b)knowledge that the act or omission causing death will probably cause the death of or grievous harm to some person, whether that person is the person actually killed or not, although such knowledge is accompanied by indifference whether death or grievous bodily harm is caused or not, or by a wish that it may not be caused;(c)an intent to commit a felony;(d)an intention by the act or omission to facilitate the flight or escape from custody of any person who has committed or attempted to commit a felony.",
            "11.The circumstances of this case, indicate that the deceased addressed the accused with a title he detested. The accused may therefore have felt provoked. I therefore, find that the prosecution has not proved the offence of murder against him. However, the prosecution has proved beyond any reasonable doubt the lesser offence of manslaughter. I accordingly reduce the charge of murder to that of manslaughter. I acquit him of the charge of murder. I find him guilty and convict him of the offence of manslaughter contrary to Section 202 as read with Section 205 of the Penal Code."

            "6.PW1 was JMM’ father to the victim. He produced the victims birth certificate. He testified that victim was 10 years of age. That on July 30, 2020 he noticed that the victim was having difficulties walking. He asked one of his female neighbors to inquire from the victim what had happened and the victim confessed to her that she had been defiled. The victim took him to about three plots from their house where the incident had happened and identified the Appellant as the person who had defiled her. He then took the victim to shelly police station and later to Likoni hospital. PW1 testified that Appellant went missing when he got wind of why he was being sought after but he got arrested on August 7, 2020.",
            "7.PW2 was Stephen Kalali a clinical officer at Likoni sub county hospital. He testified that he attended to the victim on August 4, 2020. The victim reported that she had been defiled. On examination he observed that victim had a healing abrasion on her vagina wall; broken hymen; fresh laceration on her anus and lose sphincter muscles. He produced the treatment notes, PRC form and P3 form. He further testified on cross examination that she did not examine the Appellant.",
            "8.PW3 was No. 232169 PC Mwana Ayisi Ibrahim. She testified that on August 2, 2020 PW1 reported to the station that his daughter had been defiled. The following day he came with the victim to the station who told her that a man who she used to refer to as ‘uncle’ had had sexual intercourse with her and had penetrated her vagina and anus on 29th July 2020 in the morning and during lunch time. The man had threatened to kill her if she told anyone and had later bought her biscuits in the evening. The following day she had difficulties walking and the father inquired the reason for this. Due to fear she lied that she had a boil. The pain persisted for three days prompting PW1 to check her leg but he did not see anything. PW1 called Mama Badi and Mama Yaya and requested them to check the victim’s thighs, but they did not see any boil. After this the Vitim confessed what had happened. The victim took PW1 to the Appellant’s house and pointed him out as the man who had defiled her and a scuffle ensued. PW3 then took the victim to hospital and it was confirmed that she had been defiled and there was evidence of penetration in her anus and vagina. The P3 form was filled. PW3 then went to the station and recorded the statements of the victim and PW1 but the two ladies refused to record a statement. The Appellant was arrested on 7th August 20202.",
            "9.PW4 was the Victim VN A voire dire was conducted and the Court made the assessment that she was knowledgeable enough to give sworn evidence. She testified that in 2020 she was living with her father and he used to leave for work at 7 am and come back at 7pm. And that he used to give her money for breakfast and lunch. On 29th July she was taking breakfast from a hotel. She passed near the Appellant’s house where he was sleeping at the door. He called by name. He grabbed her hand and pulled her into the house and locked the door. He took her to the bedroom and removed her skirt and underwear and used his penis to penetrate her in her vagina and anus. She told him she needed to go for a short call and he opened the door for her and she went home. It was about 10 am and she took a shower and went to play. At lunch hour she went back to the hotel and she found Appellant standing at his door. He held her by the neck and blocked her mouth and took her to the bedroom where he penetrated her in the vagina and anus. After, she went home. She had a lot of difficulty in walking and the father noticed and called the neighbors Mama Badi and Amani and she confessed to them that she had been defiled. She took the father to the Appellant’s house and pointed to him as the one who had defiled her. She was later taken to the police station then to hospital. She recorded her statement. She identified the Appellant at the dock as the man who had defiled her.",
            "10.At the close of the Prosecution’s case the Court vide a ruling on April 27, 2021 found that the Appellant had a case to answer and he was put on his defence.",
            "11.Defence called three witnesses",
            "12.DW1 was the Appellant. He gave unsworn evidence. He testified that on 10th July 2020 he went to a shop to buy charcoal and found a man who dropped his phone and after made allegations that the Appellant had stolen it. the They had a disagreement and he went home. The man then came to his house with five people who beat him up and he went to report it to the village elder. After five days he went to the village elder and police came and arrested him and took him to the police station. He was charged with defilement to his dismay as he knew nothing about the alleged offence.",
            "13.DW2 was Appellants sister, Salama Zula. She testified that the Appellant was at a shop when a man’s phone fell down. The brother gave her the phone and he told her he had stolen it. The man reported the matter to the village elder and they later came to beat up the Appellant. Later he was arrested. On cross examination she testified that she did not know the make of the phone; she did not witness the Appellant picking up the phone neither did she know the man’s whose phone had been stolen.",
            "14.D3 was Marium Chaka, the Appellant’s Aunt. She testified that on 29th July 2020 the Appellant told him that he had had a disagreement with some people in regards to a mobile phone that they claimed that he had stolen. The Appellant reported the matter to the village elder. On 22nd July a group of people came at 8 pm and demanded that they open the door and people assaulted the Appellant. He reported the matter to the village elder. He was later arrested by the police.",
            "15.Appellant tendered undated submissions. In a nutshell it was submitted that he was not positively identified as the Assailant and his was a case of mistaken identity. It was further submitted that the reason for his arrest was not in connection with the offence of defilement. It was also submitted that sentence meted out against him was extremely harsh and the period he spent in custody was not considered.",
            "16.This being a first appeal, it is the duty of this Court to re-evaluate the evidence adduced before the trial court and to arrive at its own independent conclusion whether or not to support the findings of the trial court. Duties of the first Appellate Court are well articulated in the Court Appeal case of Kiilu & Another v Republic [2005]1 KLR 174 where the Court opined, ‘‘An Appellant on a first appeal is entitled to expect the evidence as a whole to be submitted to a fresh and exhaustive examination and to the appellate Court’s own decision on the evidence. The first appellate Court must itself weigh conflicting evidence and draw its own conclusions. It is not the function of a first appellate Court merely to scrutinize the evidence to see if there was some evidence to support the lower Court’s findings and conclusions; only then can it decide whether the Magistrate’s findings should be supported. In doing so, it should make allowance for the fact that the trial Court has had the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses.”",
            "17.Having evaluated evidence on record and pleadings filed from both parties I find that issues for determination in this appeal are as follows:a)Whether the prosecution proved its case to the required standard.b)Whether the sentence meted out was legalc)Whether the prosecution proved its case to the required standard?",
            "18.It is the law in Kenya as entrenched in the constitution under Article 50 (2) (a) that an Accused person is presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved. The evidence Act Cap 80 of the Laws of Kenya at section 107 (1) provides thus: “whoever desires any court to give judgement as to any right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove those facts exist.” It is the onus of the prosecution to prove the guilt of Accused persons.",
            "19.The Court of Appeal in CRA 32 of 2017 G.O.A vs Republic (2018) stated what elements are required to be proved by the prosecution in a charge of defilement. It stated thus, “The key ingredients of the offence of defilement include proof of the age of the complainant, proof of penetration and proof that the appellant was the perpetrator of the offence.”",
            "20.Age of complaint was not in dispute in the present case. The birth certificate of the complainant was produced as pexh -1 by the investigating officer PW3. Complaint was born on 5th May 2010 making her 10 years 2months and 24 days old at the time when the alleged offence happened on 29th July 2020.",
            "21.The complainant PW4 testified the Appellant penetrated her vagina and anus using his penis. The PRC form and medical examination corroborated PW4 testimony as it was observed that the complainant’s hymen was broken and had signs of repeated penetration. Her anus had bruise at the 12 o’clock and had loose sphincter muscles and fresh lacerations. PW2, the clinical officer corroborated these assertions in his testimony as well. I find that this ingredient was proved to the required standard.",
            "22.It’s the Appellants assertion that he was mistakenly identified and he was arrested for another offence that had nothing to do with the present case. However, the complainant PW4 positively identified the Appellant as the man who defiled her. She further testified that the Appellant was known to her as ‘uncle’ as they lived in the same village. PW1, Father to PW4 also testified that PW4 took him to the house of the Appellant and pointed him out as the person who had defiled her. I find that this element was proved beyond reasonable doubt.",
            "23.In regards to the Appellant’s defence, there was no linkage made by the defence to the happenings of the current offence. The Appellant also did not report the assault he suffered on allegations of theft and there was no way of ascertaining if those events ever took place or not. I find that he failed to exonerate himself in the present offence.",
            "24.In light of the foregoing it is my finding that the conviction made by the trial court was proper and safe.",
            "25.Under Section 8(2) of the Sexual Offences Act, where the victim is less than eleven years, like PW4 was, upon conviction, one is, liable’ to be sentenced to life imprisonment.’’ What does “shall be liable” mean in law?” The court of Appeal for East Africa in the case of Opoya v Uganda [1967] EA 752 had an opportunity to clarify and explain the words “shall be liable on conviction to suffer death”. The court held that in construction of penal laws, the words “shall be liable on conviction to suffer death” provide a maximum sentence only and the courts have discretion to impose sentences of death or imprisonment. It follows that for the present offence the maximum sentence is life imprisonment. The Appellant was sentenced to serve 50 years in prison. This was not illegal as it was within range and as per the Magistrate’s discretion. However, I find that the term of 50 years will not meet all objectives of sentencing as provided in the Judicial sentencing and policy guidelines particularly the objective of rehabilitation as the sentence leans more on the retribution aspect. I therefore substitute it with a sentence of 30 years to begin when Appellant was placed in custody on August 10, 2020."

            "1.The appellant was charged with three counts for the offences of: obtaining money by false pretenses contrary to section 313 of the Penal Code; personation contrary to section 382 of the Penal Code; and making a false document contrary to section 347(a) of the Penal Code. According to the charge sheet, all these offences were allegedly committed jointly with others not before the court.",
            "2.The particulars all relate to a fraudulent sale transaction to Luka Nyamu Gachara, and Jamleck Muchira Gachara of land Parcel No Mwea/Miuu/13953/3767 for Kshs 540,000/- by false pretenses; whilst falsely presenting herself to be Ciriaka Wanjiru Murage, whilst knowing this to be false; and finally, by making a false document, namely a national identity card issued to Ciriaka Wanjiru Murage.",
            "3.Following a hearing in which eight (8) prosecution witnesses and the accused testified, the appellant was found guilty on all counts, convicted, and sentenced to consecutive sentences as follows:Count 1 Two (2) years in jail; Count 2 One (1) year in jail; and Count 3 Two (2) years in jail.",
            "4.Dissatisfied, the appellant appeals seeking that the conviction be quashed and sentence set aside. Her amended grounds of appeal are as follows:1.That the Hon. Trial Magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to find there were material contradictions and inconsistences which went to the root of the whole of the prosecution’s case.2.That the Hon. Trial Magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to find that the mode of arrest was greatly unjustified by the evidence.3.That the Hon. Trial Magistrate erred in law and fact by [not] giving regard to the appellant’s defense.4.That the Hon. Trial Magistrate erred in law and fact by meting out a sentence that was both harsh and excessive in the circumstances underlying.5.Parties filed written submissions to dispose of the appeal as directed by the court.",
            "6.The appellant generally contends that to secure a conviction it was incumbent on the prosecution to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, all the elements of the crime of obtaining money by false pretense, personating and making false documents together with a common intention (albeit). This appeal contents that the prosecution failed to prove the elements of identification that the Appellant committed the said offence, that statutory provisions were not followed and finally that the sentence was excessive in the circumstances bearing.",
            "7.The appellant pointed out that PW1 said he was telephoned by his mother – when he was at Morgan – who told him that a woman had some land. Yet that he later said his mother telephoned and told him a woman had land, and he and his brother went to where they were near the road. On the other hand, PW3 alleged that the accused telephoned him while at Itangi with PW1 and PW2 looking for land. Further, that the mother who is PW3 states that she was with her sons when the accused called her whereas PW1 clearly stated that he was alone with his brother.",
            "8.Further, the appellant pointed out that PW1 stated in page 11 line 15-1 ROA as follows: “thus withdrew Ksh.600,000 out of which I gave accused Ksh.540,000”. That PW2 stated in page 15 line 8 that “Nancy had the money and she gave accused”.  On the other hand, Nancy herself who is PW3 clearly stated in page 17 line 10-11 that, “we withdrewKsh.600,000 which I gave to Manegene who gave the accused, we paid Ksh540,000”.",
            "9.She argues that since it was not clear who received the alleged as the witnesses contradict each other as to who received it, their overall evidence cannot convince the court that she was present was present during the said transactions. She asserts that the contradictions are not minor but go to the root of the case and also to the culpability of the appellant. She urges the court to resolve the discrepancy in her favour.",
            "10.The appellant submits that her arrest was not justified by any evidence. Indeed, that the narrative of the various prosecution witnesses is that a large amount of money was stolen from them yet no evidence of recovery has been led to prove that wild allegation.",
            "11.She urges that there was no proof of her possession of any money, and relies on the case of Joseph Kisilu Mulinge versus Republic [2014] eKLR shere the court stated:“In order to prove possession, there must be acceptable evidence as to search of the suspect and recovery of the alleged stolen property and any discredited evidence on the same cannot suffice no matter how many witnesses”.",
            "12.She submits that failure to show any evidence of recovery of the alleged stolen cash waters down the whole evidence on charges implicating the Appellant, and is tantamount to hearsay evidence.",
            "13.The appellant also submits that the case against her was not proved by any positive identification, the evidence was not only contradictory but the same could not be relied on because of the many unfilled gaps it left. The prosecution bore the burden of proving the accused person guilty beyond all reasonable doubt through concrete evidence as the perpetrator of the offence (s) therein.",
            "14.On sentence, she submits that the trial court erred by meting out sentence to run consecutively in three offences which occurred albeit in the same transaction. She states that Section 14 of the Criminal Procedure provides as follows:“\n14.1Subject to subsection (3), when a person is convicted at one trial of two or more distinct offences, the court may sentence him, for the offences, to the several punishments prescribed therefore which the court is competent to impose; and those punishments when consisting of imprisonment shall commence the one after the expiration of the other in the order the court may direct, unless the court directs that the punishment shall run concurrently.\n\n\n14.2.In the case of consecutive sentences, it shall not be necessary for the court, by reason only of the aggregate punishment for the several offences being in excess of the punishment which it is competent to improve on conviction of a single offence, to send the offender to trial before a Higher Court.\n\n\n14.3Except in cases to which Section 7 [1] applies, nothing in this section shall authorize a subordinate court to pass on any person at one trial, consecutive sentences:\n\na)of imprisonment which amount in the aggregate to more than fourteen years, or twice the amount of imprisonment which the court in the exercise of its ordinary jurisdiction, is competent to improve whichever is the less: orb)of fines which amount in the aggregate to more than twice the amount which the court is so competent to impose.”",
            "14.1Subject to subsection (3), when a person is convicted at one trial of two or more distinct offences, the court may sentence him, for the offences, to the several punishments prescribed therefore which the court is competent to impose; and those punishments when consisting of imprisonment shall commence the one after the expiration of the other in the order the court may direct, unless the court directs that the punishment shall run concurrently.",
            "14.2.In the case of consecutive sentences, it shall not be necessary for the court, by reason only of the aggregate punishment for the several offences being in excess of the punishment which it is competent to improve on conviction of a single offence, to send the offender to trial before a Higher Court.",
            "14.3Except in cases to which Section 7 [1] applies, nothing in this section shall authorize a subordinate court to pass on any person at one trial, consecutive sentences:",
            "15.Her argument is that in her case, the sentences ought to have been concurrent in that the practice is that where a person commits more than one offence at the same time and in the same transaction, save in very exceptional circumstances the courts impose concurrent sentences. On this score she refers to the case of Sawadi Mukasa s/o Abdula Aliguraisa [1946] 13, EACA 97, then the Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa is a judgment read by Sir Joseph Sheridan stated“That is still good practice. As a general principle the practice is that if an accused person commits a series of offences at the same time in an act/transaction a concurrent sentence should be given. However, if separate and distinct offences are committed in different criminal transaction, even though the counts may be in one charge sheet and one trial, it is not illegal to mete out a consecutive term of imprisonment”.",
            "16.As for the meaning of the phrase “same transaction”, the same was defined in Republic versus Saidi Nsabuga s/o Juma & Another [1941] EACA and revisited again in Nayhan versus Republic [1965] the court states as follows:“If a series of acts are so connected together by proximity of time, criminality or criminal intent, continuity of action purpose or by relation of cause and effect was to constitute one transaction then the offences constituted by these series of acts are committed in the course of the same transaction. The one transaction rule requires that where two or more offences are committed in the course of a single transaction, the sentencing court should consider an order for concurrent instead of consecutive”.",
            "17.She prays that this court will find that the counts complained above occurred in a series of a single transactions, and urges that the court will order the sentences to run concurrently.",
            "18.The prosecution submitted on three prongs, namely: Whether the appellant was convicted on unjustified, contradictory and inconsistent evidence; Whether the trial court ignored the appellant’s defence; and Whether the sentence was both harsh and excessive.",
            "19.On the first prong the prosecution highlighted the evidence of PW1 (Luka Nyamu Gachara), PW2 (Jamleck Muchira Gachara) and PW4 (Stanley Waweru Manegene) The DPP pointed out PW1 and PW2 testified as to how they sought and identified land, entered into negotiations for the purchase with the appellant and one Stanley Murage, and purchased the land after being shown the title by the said Stanley Murage. Exhibits for the purchase transaction were also referred to by the DPP Subsequent to the purchase they went to farm the land only to be told by PW3, the true owner, that the land was not on sale.",
            "20.On the second prong, the appellant argued that the prosecution case was not made up of good evidence, and that the defence case was left intact although not seriously taken into account by the trial magistrate",
            "21.On the third prong the prosecution stated that the offences of obtaining by false pretenses, impersonating and forgery attract maximum sentences of three years, seven years and three years, respectively. Accordingly, the prosecution pointed out that the trial court had in fact been lenient.",
            "22.It is trite that the duty of this court on a first appeal is to re-evaluate all the evidence on record and come to its own conclusions, being mindful that it did not itself see and hear the witnesses itself, nor assess their demeanour as stated in Okeno v Republic [1972] EA 32. More recently, in David Njuguna Wairimu v Republic [2010] eKLR, the Court of Appeal stated that duty as follows:“The duty of the first appellate court is to analyse and re-evaluate the evidence which was before the trial court and itself come to its own conclusions on that evidence without overlooking the conclusions of the trial court. There are instances where the first appellate court may, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, come to the same conclusions as those of the lower court. It may rehash those conclusions. We do not think there is anything objectionable in doing so, provided it is clear that the court has considered the evidence on the basis of the law and the evidence to satisfy itself on the correctness of the decision.”",
            "23.In reviewing and re-evaluating the evidence, the court must keep its eye on the elements of each of the offences that must be proved by the state using the facts on record. Thus, in cases of multiple counts such as this one, the prosecution is required to prove the offence in respect of each of the counts.",
            "24.The evidence on record is summarized as follows.",
            "25.PW1 Luka Nyamu Gachara testified that on 25th March 2016, he was looking for land to buy. He was with his brother Jamleck Muchira Gachara (PW2), when his step mother Nancy Wanjiku (PW3) advised him that she had information that a woman, the accused, had land. He and his brother met the accused, whom he had not known before, and they negotiated a price of Kshs 180,000/- per acre. The accused told them that her husband Stanley Waweru Manegene was the owner.",
            "26.The next day they went to Kerugoya to meet the owner. They met a man who went by the name Stanley Manegene, who the accused told them was her husband. He told them that his wife had been admitted with a child at Karira.",
            "27.On 31/3/2016 they met the accused, this time with her husband at Kerugoya in Ikahu Ngangah’s office. They came to know her name as Ciaraka Wanjiru Murage, PW1 was curious as to why she did not go by the husband’s name, and she told him the husband was a drunk and unco-operative. That he would eat all the money alone.",
            "28.Eventually, they agreed on payments after accused had rejected payment through the bank. The advocate drew the sale agreement after they had provided identity cards, and allotment letter as proof of the title No Mwea/ Miuu/ 13963/3767. The land had been allocated by the County Council to Stanley Waweru Manegene. PW1 withdrew Kshs 600,000/- from his mother’s account as per withdrawal slip (MFI 3) and she carried it. Out of that money they paid Kshs 540,000/- for three acres. They also executed a sale agreement (MFI 4). His mother is the one who gave the money to the accused.",
            "29.After buying the land PW1 went to plant trees on it but was confronted by someone who said the land was not for sale. On calling the accused, he was unable to get her as she switched off her phone. He later reported to the police.",
            "30.PW2 Jamleck Muchira Gachara, testified that he, his brother, PW1 and mother, PW3, were looking for land to buy. His mother was alerted about some land by Ciaraka Wanjiru, the accused. They eventually met the accused who showed them the land. They liked it and agreed to meet in Kerugoya. They paid 540,000/- for 3 acres, after they had been shown the land title by Stanley Manegene the owner. The money was paid in cash to the accused from PW3’s account, who had carried it.",
            "31.In cross examination, PW2 confirmed that they went to a lawyer’s office where an agreement was drawn; the accused and her husband produced ID cards; and the title document was produced by Stanley Manegene.",
            "32.PW3, Nancy Wanjiku Gacara testified that the accused telephoned her while she was with PW1 and PW2 looking for land. She did not know how the accused got her number, and had not known her name before they met to execute the sale agreement.",
            "33.The accused showed them the land, which they liked, and told them it belonged to her husband. They were shown a title for the land by Stanley Manegene, and agreed to pay the money in Kerugoya before an advocate. The money came from her account in Co-operative Bank where she withdrew 600,000/-. The accused and her husband gave their IDs to the lawyer who drew the agreement. She paid Kshs 540,000/- to Stanley Manegene who gave the money to the accused.",
            "34.In cross examination, she said the accused called her while she was in Itangi with PW1 and PW2, and told her she had a plot that belonged to her husband; that they met at Kerugogoya with Manegene, that the agreement was drawn by the advocate and executed. That she carried part of the money, Kshs 300,000/-, whilst PW1 carried the other 300,000/-.",
            "35.PW4 Stanley Waweru Manegene, is the Assistant Chief of Mahigaini sub-location. He testified that he is the owner of LR No 3767 South Ngariama, which he acquired in 2007 through the County Council. He produced the receipts for the purchase dated 2/4/2007, and the application fee receipt. He was never given a title because they were not available for South Ngariama, but he retained possession of the parcel of land,",
            "36.PW4 testified that his wife is Esther Wanjiru Wawera. They were not selling the land. He and his wife were summoned by CID officers, and confirmed that they had not instructed anyone to sell the land, and that he has no relative who bears his name. He confirmed that the County Council ballot papers have his ID number, land parcel number and stamp of the County Council. In cross examination, he said the CID directed him to check the position of his land, and he did a search. He found the land was still in his name. his land was vacant and remained so.",
            "37.PW5, Stella Mwai, is the Registrar of Persons Mwea East, where she has worked for five years. She produced two ID Cards. The first was ID No 14077934 S. No. 209030921 under the name Ciaraka Wanjiru Murage. Under the Registrar’s data base, the ID belongs to Ciaraka Wanjiru Murage, born in 1948 in Kirinyaga Central. In the card given to her, however, the date of birth is1968, which differes from the Registrar’s records; and the bearer is indicated as being from Kirinyaga Gichugu location contrary to the data base",
            "38.The second ID was No 11699126 S. No. 213432706 bearing the name Stanley Waweru Manegene. His details in their records show the ID S No is 2025209803 and he was born in Kirinyaga Central in 1973.",
            "39.She produced reports PExb 2a & 2b and PExb 7 and asserted that the IDs given to her do not match the details in the records of the Registrar. In cross examination, PW5 referred to the ID given to her as belonging to Ciaraka as fake.",
            "40.PW6 Martin Ikahu Ngangah is an Advocate of the High Court of Kenya, practicing in Kerugoya. He said that on 31/3/2016 he had five walk-in clients who wanted to do a land sale agreement over LR No Miuu/13963/3767 measuring 3 acres at Kshs 540,000/-. He requested title documents and was given an allotment letter form the County Council. The seller was Stanley Waweru Manegene. The purchasers were Luka Nyamu and Jamleck Muchira",
            "41.He received the parties’ ID cards and drafted the sale agreement. The parties signed or thumb-printed the agreements. The purchasers paid the purchase price although he did not see the bank deposit slips. One of the witnesses was Ciaraka Wanjiru, whose relation to the parties he could not tell. He identified the copies of IDs PExbs 2a and 2b.",
            "42.In cross examination, he noted that the vendor received the purchase price as per the agreement and that it was not standard practice for a witness to be given the purchase price. He said the appellant’s face was unfamiliar as the clients were all walk in clients that he saw for the first time.",
            "43.PW7 Arthur Kamau Munene was the County Assistant Director of Security and Compliance. He testified that the title Mwea/Miuu/13963/3767 belonged to Stanley Manegene through allotment by the defunct Council; that the allottee are in a register of owners, and their ID numbers are in the application forms. He identified the survey fee receipt (MFI 1); and confirmed that title deeds had not been issued in Ngariama Scheme.",
            "44.In cross examination, he stated that PExb 8 had not been issued to Manegene as an ownership document; and that Manegene had not completed payment. In re-examination he stated that when an original owner has not completed payment they do not allow a transfer to take place.",
            "45.PW8 Cpl Eleseba Bungei was the Investigating Officer. She testified that the case was reported in July 2016 by Luka Nyamu and Jamleck Gathara who claimed the accused conned them of money involving sale of Title No Mwea/Muui/13963/3769. According to her, the victims reported that the accused had claimed to be the wife of Stanley Waweru Manegene and introduced herself as Ciaraka Wanjiru Murage. She introduced Luka Nyamu to then transaction and pointed out the land in Ngariama. They then went to an advocates office in Kerugoya and signed a sale agreement, PExb 4.",
            "46.Later, Luka Nyamu discovered that Ciaraka Wanjiru was actually Rosemary Mithamo and the police arrested and charged her. She was not able to trace the Stanly Manegene in the sale agreement, but they traced th genuine Stanley who came with his wife. The complainants were unable to identify the real Stanley or his wife.",
            "47.PW8 produced PExb 3, the withdrawal slip from the Co-operative Bank; PExb4 the sale agreement; PExb 5&6 the receipts from the County Council. She said she charged the accused with the various counts because the accused used a fake ID to sell land and as a result obtained money with a person she described as her husband.",
            "48.In cross examination, she admitted that she had not witnessed the accused making of a false document; and that the ID was in her possession. She stated that it was not possible to doctor a photcopy of an ID card. She also admitted that she did not witness the payment of the purchase price and relied on the statements of the victims",
            "49.In her defence, the Accused gave a sworn statement and denied the charges. She said she was a business lady living in Thika; that she was arrested whilst in court and was told at the police station that she had taken PW1s money; that PW1 was brought to the station and said he knew her husband had taken 540,000/- over a land sale.",
            "50.She said she had no knowledge of the alleged parcel of land whose sale she was alleged to be a witness of; that PW1 claimed he would maintain his position because she had another similar case in court and that she was shown a sale agreement which had names different from hers. She claimed she had lost her identity card in January in Mwea and had reported, hence she didn’t have an ID card at the time.",
            "51.The accused alleged the case was a frame up by Luka because of the case in court, yet she didn’t know him.",
            "52.It is on this evidence that the accused was convicted and sentenced by the trial court.",
            "53.The first count was obtaining money by false pretenses. For the offence to hold, the prosecution must prove the three essential elements of the offence of obtaining by false pretences, namely:i.Obtaining something capable of being stolen;ii.Obtaining through false pretences; andiii.Obtaining with intent to defraud.",
            "54.In the case Gerald Ndoho Munjuga v R HC Criminal Appeal No. 213 of 2011 (Nyeri) Mativo, J, quoting with approval from the High Court of Botswana in Lesholo & Another v The State, which case dealt with an offence of this nature, the court held:i.To prove the offence of obtaining by false pretence, the accused must by a false pretence, with intent to defraud, obtain something of value capable of being stolen from another person. The prosecution must prove the false pretence together with a fraudulent intention in obtaining the property of the person cheated.ii.A false pretence has been held to be a representation by the accused person which to his knowledge is not true. A false pretence will constitute a false pretence when it relates to a present or past fact or facts. It is not false pretence if it is made in relation to the future even if it is made fraudulently. Where however the representation speaks both of a future promise and couples it with false statements of existing or past facts the representation will amount to a false pretence if the alleged existing facts are false.iii.…......... The representation must be made with the specific purpose of getting money from the complainant which he/she would not have given had the true facts been revealed to him.”",
            "55.Was there something capable of being stolen? The money with which the complainants sought to buy the land was capable of being stolen. The evidence of PW1 and 2 was that the accused showed them the land, and they negotiated its price. PW1 &2 testified that the 600,000/ was withdrawn from their mother’s account in Cooperative Bank. It was from this amount that they paid the Kshs 540,000/- purchase money. PW1 said in cross examination that his mother had carried the money, gave it to the Manegene who gave it to the accused posing as his wife.",
            "56.PW2s evidence was that the purchase money was given to the accused; and PW3s evidence was that",
            "57.The accused clearly represented herself as capable of selling the land. She was the one who showed it to PW1,2, and 3. The money was given on the strength of the representation. This occurred in relation to the facts then at hand. It constituted a false pretence it relates to a present or past fact or facts as to the ownership of the land by her alleged husband. It is also clear that as a result of the false pretence she received the money.",
            "58.The trial magistrate found the accused initiated the transaction, and obtained the money through Manegene. From the foregoing, all the ingredients of the offence were proved, and the trial magistrate cannot be faulted for the conviction.",
            "59.The second count was that of making a false document. The offence has been well described in authorities. In Serpepi Sanja Siromo v Republic [2020] eKLR the court stated that:“Section 345 of the Penal Code defines forgery as “the making of a false document with intent to defraud or to deceive.” Section 347 deals with making of a document while section 348 defines intent to defraud. The prosecution was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant forged the sale agreement dated 20th November 2008; it was false and was intended to defraud.",
            "60.In Patrick Njuguna Richu v Republic [2018] eKLR the court adopted the definition of a false document as defined in R v Dodge and Harris (1971) 2 ALL E.R. 1523 and stated:“A document is false must tell a lie about itself and not about the maker. We think the position is better put, by stating that, the false document is forged if it is made to be used as genuine. To defraud is, by deceit, to induce a course of action: Omar Bin Salem V R(1950) 17 EACA 158, and to defraud is not confined to the idea of depriving a man by deceit of some economic advantage or inflicting upon him some economic loss” see Samuel –v- Republic.”",
            "61.The ingredients which prove the offence are: that the document is made by the accused; that the document tells a lie about itself; and that the document is made so as to be used as if it were genuine.",
            "62.In Dennis Binyenya v Republic [2018] eKLR the court held that from the definition, the offence constitutes the following ingredients:i.proof of the making, signing or execution of a document and that the same was done by the accused,ii.proof that the making, signing or execution was without lawful authority or excuse andiii.proof that the making, signing and execution was with the intention to defraud or deceive.",
            "63.In R v Dodge and Harris[1971] 2 All ER 1523 Phillimore L.J further broke down the definition of a false document as follows:“A document is false… if the whole or any material part thereof purports to be made by or on behalf or on account of a person who did not make it or authorize its making … or if, though made by or on behalf of or on account of the person by whom or by whose authority it purports to have been made, the time or place of making, where either is material,.………and in particular a document is false:- (a) if any material alteration, whether by addition, insertion, obliteration, erasure, removal, or otherwise, has been made therein; (b) if the whole or some material part of it purports to be made by or on behalf of a fictitious or deceased person; (c) if, though made in the name of an existing person, it is made by him or by his authority with the intention that it should pass as having been made by some person, real or fictitious, other than the person who made or authorized it.”",
            "64.In summary, all these authorities lay out the principles that a document is false if it tells an untruth about itself, or contains material alterations, and is intended to be used as if it were genuine.",
            "65.The evidence here was that the ID card of the accused was produced to the Advocate as a witness to the sale agreement that he drew for the transaction. PW6 said he was given the ID cards to draw the agreement; his secretary or receptionist took the IDs and photocopied them. He confirmed he drew the agreement, with the ID Number of Ciriaka Wanjiru Murage,No 14077934 printed into agreement, as one of the witnesses. Similarly, all the parties’ ID numbers were printed into the agreement.",
            "66.When the photocopy of the card with the name of Ciriaka Wanjiru was given to the Registrar of Persons PW5, she compared it to the official records. She found that the ID Number belonged to a person known by that name (Ciriaka Wanjiru Murage) who was born in 1948, whilst the photocopy showed the holder to have been born in 1968. PW6 confirmed the ID given to her to “differs with [the] records”, and described it as a “fake” ID.",
            "67.PW1, 2 and 3 confirmed that the accused was the person who was present at the signing of the agreement and was the one to whom the purchase money was eventually given. Consequently, despite her denials, the strong evidence of the witnesses PW1-3 and 6 places the ID in her possession at the signing of the sale agreement, whilst the evidence of PW5 shows that the ID she produced and which was relied upon was a fake.",
            "68.On this count, I also find no basis to interfere with the trial court’s findings and conclusions.",
            "69.The third count was the offence of personation. The offence is proved if the prosecution can show that the accused falsely represented himself to be some other person.",
            "70.The offence was dealt with by Muriithi, J in  Gideon Leteipa Lenkume v Republic [2020] eKLR, Muriithi, J as follows:“The offence of personation c/s 382 of the Penal Code carries a sentence of imprisonment as follows:382. Personation in general1.Any person who, with intent to defraud any person, falsely represents himself to be some other person, living or dead, is guilty of a misdemeanor.2.If the representation is that the offender is a person entitled by will or operation of law to any specific property and he commits the offence to obtain such property or possession thereof, he is liable to imprisonment for seven years.”The section 382 creates two offences (1) where the offender only “falsely represents himself to be some other person” and (2) where the offender represents that he is “entitled by will or operation of law to any specific property and he commits the offence to obtain such property or possession thereof”. In the former case he is liable to be punished under the general penalty for misdemeanour. In the latter special category the offender is liable to be punished by imprisonment for seven years.”",
            "71.It is clear from the evidence already analysed, that the accused represented herself as, and went by, the name Ciaraka Wanjiru Murage; she gave an ID by that name to PW6 who printed it into the sale agreement where she was a witness, and also obtained the purchase money from Manegene.",
            "72.This is a clear case that the accused falsely representing herself to be Ciaraka Wanjiru Murage, Additionally, she also falsely represented herself as the wife to the land owner, Stanley Manegene. The trial magistrate was entitled to make the conviction on this basis",
            "73.The defendant’s evidence that she lost her ID card and was surprised to see a copy in court. She did not indicate whether she had ever followed up the lost card, and that evidence appears merely convenient. She said she had another case in court 1 with similar charges, and attributed the present case to a frame up by Luka PW3, as follows:“This case is a frame up by Luka because of the case in court 1, yet I don’t even know him”",
            "74.Her evidence here is curious to say the least. The appellant asserted that there was a frame up by Luka a person she said she did not even know. It is not reasonable to accept, without further explanation, that there would be a frame up by a person one doesn’t know and with unexplained motive.",
            "75.Consequently, I do not find her evidence to be useful in this case. As such, I find no reason to interfere with the trial court’s ultimate findings and conclusions, and would not disturb them.",
            "76.Accordingly, the convictions are confirmed in respect of all the counts.",
            "77.Similarly, the sentences affirmed as being in the trial court’s powers to hand down. As argued by the prosecution, the trial court’s sentence was lenient to the extent that the penalty for count 1 is a maximum of 3 years’ imprisonment, count 2 attracts 7 years’ imprisonment, and count 3 attracts up to 3 years. The exercise of the trial magistrate’s discretion in sentencing cannot be faulted.",
            "78.The appeal is therefore dismissed in its entirety.",
            "79.Orders Accordingly."

            "1.Dennis Odiwuor Opawa the appellant herein, was convicted of the offence of defilement contrary to section 8 (1) (3) [sic] of the Sexual Offences Act No.3 of 2006.",
            "2.The particulars of the offence were that on the 9th day of July, 2016 at [particulars withheld] Estate in Homa Bay District of Homa Bay County intentionally and unlawfully caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of M.A. O., a child aged 12 years.",
            "3.He was charge alternatively with an offence of an indecent act with a child contrary to section 11 (1) of the Sexual Offences Act No.3 of 2006. The particulars were that on the 9th day of August, 2016 at [particulars withheld] Estate in Homa Day District of Homa Bay County he intentionally touched the breasts and the vagina of M.A. O., a child aged 12 years with his penis.",
            "4.The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 15 years for the offence of defilement and was discharged in the alternative charge. He has appealed against both conviction and sentence.",
            "5.The appellant was in person. He raised 19 grounds of appeal which I have summarised as follows:a)The appellant was not accorded a fair trial as enshrined in article 50(2) of the constitution.b)The trial magistrate failed to conduct a voir dire examination to the alleged minor to ascertain if she understood the nature of oath.c)The learned trial magistrate failed to warn himself against the danger of convicting the appellant on uncorroborated evidence of the complainant.d)The prosecution failed to call Emily to testify.e)The learned trial magistrate failed to give a benefit to doubt to the appellant after the prosecution failed to produce exhibits mentioned by the complainant which were never escorted to government chemist for analysis on allegation that they were blood stained.f)The learned trial magistrate erred by convicting the appellant when there was no government analysis’s report confirming that the alleged blood stains on complainants pant belonged to the appellant or the complainant.g)The learned trial magistrate erred by dismissing the defence.",
            "6.The appeal was opposed by the state, through Ochengo Justus who raised the following grounds:a)That there was overwhelming evidence against the appellant.b)The appellant’s actions of running away after committing the offence was inconsistent with his innocence.c)The appellant’s further action of absconding court and trying to escape to the neighbouring state of Uganda during trial was inconsistent to his innocence.d)This was a case of recognition, the offence happened in broad day light, there was no mistaken identity.e)The medical officer who examined the victim concluded that the degree of injury as grievous harm. He further testified that the injuries were permanent and affected the normal operation of the complainant.",
            "7.This is a first appellate court. As expected, I have analyzed and evaluated afresh all the evidence adduced before the lower court and I have drawn my own conclusions while bearing in mind that I neither saw nor heard any of the witnesses. I will be guided by the celebrated case of Okeno vs. Republic [1972] EA 32.",
            "8.Section 8 (1) (3) of the Sexual Offences Act does not exist. The charge to that extent was erroneously drafted. It ought to have read:…contrary to section 8 (1) as read with section 8 (3) of the Sexual Offences Act …",
            "9.Since the appellant fully participated in the trial, I find that he was not in any way prejudiced and the error is curable under section 382 of the Criminal Procedure Code.",
            "10.When this matter came up for hearing on 26th September, 2016 before P. Mayova, SRM, the appellant informed the court that he had not been supplied with witness statements. The court ordered that the appellant be supplied with treatment notes of the girl and the case to proceed after 30 minutes. This was a breach of the appellant’s right to fair trial for the prosecution was not to rely solely on the treatment notes but also the statement of the complainant and other witnesses. Even if he had been supplied with the statement together with the treatment notes, I wonder whether the 30 minutes would have been adequate to him. Article 50 (2) (c) & (j) provides:Every accused person has the right to a fair trial, which includes the right—c)) to have adequate time and facilities to prepare a defence;…(j)j) to be informed in advance of the evidence the prosecution intends to rely on, and to have reasonable access to that evidence;The court ought to have balanced the right of the child and that of the appellant and accord him sufficient time to prepare after the supply of all the statements. Preparation in my view is not meant to be piecemeal but wholly.The appellant complained that the court did not conduct a voir dire examination in respect of the complainant whose age was given in the charge sheet as 12 years. According the Court of Appel in the case of Kibangeny Arap Kolil vs. R [1959] EA 92 for the purposes of section 19(1) of the Oaths and Statutory Declaration Act the expression ‘child of tender years’ in the absence of special circumstances, it took it to mean any child of any age, or apparent age, of under fourteen years. There was therefore need to conduct a voir dire.",
            "11.The Court of Appeal in John Wambua Mutunga v Republic [2005] eKLR gave guidance on voir dire examination as follows:“There are two steps to be borne in mind. The first step is for the court to ascertain whether the child understands the nature of an oath. An investigation to this effect must be done by the court immediately the child – witness appears in court. The investigation need not be a long one but it has to be done and has to be directed to the particular question whether the child understands the nature of an oath. If the answer to this question is in the affirmative, then, the court proceeds to swear or affirm the child and to take his or her evidence upon oath. On the other hand, if the child – witness does not understand the nature of an oath, he or she is not necessarily disqualified from giving evidence. The second step then follows. The court may still receive his evidence if the court is satisfied, upon investigation, that he is possessed of sufficient intelligence and understands the duty of speaking the truth. Again investigation in this respect need not be a long one but it must be done and when done, it must appear on record. Some basic but elementary questions may be asked of the child to assess the level of his intelligence and whether he understands the duty of speaking the truth or otherwise. Where the court is so satisfied, then, the court will proceed to record unsworn evidence from the child – witness.Before the hearing of the evidence of the complainant commenced, this is what the record indicates:Child: I am a Christian. I am 12 years old. This is a Bible. I am in class five.Court: Child is competent to give sworn evidence.I therefore agree with the appellant that the trial magistrate (P. Mayova) did not conduct a voir dire examination.",
            "12.The proviso to section 124 of the Evidence Act provides:Provided that where in a criminal case involving a sexual offence the only evidence is that of the alleged victim of the offence, the court shall receive the evidence of the alleged victim and proceed to convict the accused person if, for reasons to be recorded in the proceedings, the court is satisfied that the alleged victim is telling the truth.This therefore took away the mandatory requirement for corroboration in sexual offences cases where the only witness is the victim, subject to the conditions prescribed therein.",
            "13.Dr. Ngome James (PW2) adduced medical evidence for the prosecution. He informed the court that the complainant was presented to Homa Bay County Referral Hospital where she was examined by a clinical officer called Reuben on 10th July, 2016. Her genitalia was intact with no tears or bruises. The only finding was thick whitish discharge. He therefore concluded that there was no immediate penetration.",
            "14.On her part the complainant testified that the appellant defiled her on 9th July, 2016. She told Emily who took her to hospital. Emily was not called and no explanation was given as to why she was not called. The Court of Appeal in the case of  Bukenya v Uganda [1972] EA 549, (Lutta Ag. Vice President) held:The prosecution must make available all witnesses necessary to establish the truth even if their evidence may be inconsistent.Where the evidence called is barely adequate, the Court may infer that the evidence of uncalled witnesses would have tended to be adverse to the prosecution.Failure to call Emily to adduce evidence on what the complainant allegedly told her, was fatal to the prosecution case.",
            "15.There was contradiction in the evidence of the complainant and that of the doctor that she was defiled on 9th July, 2016. According to the doctor, upon her examination on 10th July, 2016 there were no telltale signs. It is trite that sexual congress even with a willing adult who is not adequately prepared for the congress, there are always signs of lacerations or abrasions. For a child of 12 years, there would be all obvious indications of defilement.",
            "16.In opposing the appeal, the learned counsel asked the court to look at the conduct of the appellant of absconding while the case ws still in pendency. This cannot be taken as evidence against the appellant unless there was strong evidence against him. It is common knowledge that some innocent people may abscond for fear of the court and the court process.",
            "17.I was urged convict on the lesser charge of an indecent act with a child contrary to section 11 (1) of the Sexual Offences Act, should I conclude that the offence of defilement was not proved. The particulars in the alternative charge alleged that the appellant intentionally touched the breasts and the vagina of M.A. O., a child aged 12 years with his penis. Unfortunately nowhere did the complainant testify that the penis was used to touch her breasts and vagina. It is trite law that where the particulars of the offence are at variance with the charge, the accused is entitled to an acquittal. This was held in the case of John Brown Shilenje v R. High Court (NBI) Criminal Appeal No 181 of 1981 (unreported).When the trial court convicts on the substantive charge, the correct procedure is to make no finding on the alternative charge. It was erroneous therefore for the learned magistrate to proceed to discharge the appellant on the alternative charge.",
            "18.The upshot of the foregoing analysis of the evidence is that the conviction of the appellant was not supported by the evidence on record. It was unsafe. I therefore quash the conviction and set the sentence aside. The appellant is set at liberty unless if otherwise lawfully held."

        },
        "judgement": [
            "1.Maureen Mruya, and Robinson Mruya, the first and second accused respectively, are charged with murder contrary to S.203 as read with S.204 of the penal code, in that, on the October 6, 2020 at Kwangamor sub location in Teso South – Busia County murdered Wycliffe Ndeke (deceased).",
            "2.The case for the prosecution was that on the material date in the forenoon a group of boys was gathered at the bank of a river scooping river sand when an altercation occurred between themselves over a radio or radio battery being charged on behalf of one of them (deceased) by another called Davy who then left the scene in a huff and was followed by the other boys including Dickson Wanjala (PW 1), Levin Okware (PW 3) and the deceased.",
            "3.On arrival at Davy’s home, the boys met his brother Robinson (accused two) who led them to Davy. At that juncture, Davy started to cry. His mother (accused one) shortly thereafter appeared at the scene and immediately set upon the deceased and the other boys. She slapped the deceased and instructed the second accused to fetch a thick stick or “rungu” which was then handed over to her whereupon she used it to hit the deceased on the head.",
            "4.The first accused also instructed the second accused, her son, to also hit the deceased with the rungu. She alleged that the deceased and the other boys who accompanied him to the scene were rogues and while she was in the process of assaulting them her neighbour Everlyn Amoit (PW 2) appeared at the scene after hearing screams and shouts emanating from there. She (PW 2) found the first accused assaulting the deceased with the rungu which she then handed over to the second accused on realizing that she (PW 2) was at the scene.",
            "5.Everlyn (PW 2) confronted the first accused and attempted to wrestle from her a machete (panga) that she was holding. The first accused resisted and handed over the panga to the second accused who ran away with it. She (PW 2) noted that the deceased had a head injury. She assisted and took him to her house where he cried aloud complaining that he was in pain. Thereafter, he ran to his home.",
            "6.The deceased arrived at his home where he lived with his grandmother, Rispa Auma Okwara (PW 4), while staggering and looking dazed. He went straight to bed and slept. The grandmother did not think much of it and opined that he was tired or unwell with malaria until Everlyn (PW 2) appeared at her home and informed her that the deceased had been assaulted by the first accused.",
            "7.The grandmother immediately thereafter proceeded to the homestead of the first accused and questioned her. The first accused denied assaulting the deceased but alleged that her children had been attacked by thugs. This prompted the grandmother to report the matter to the police before taking the deceased to Amukura Health Centre where he was examined and given some drugs without being admitted although his condition had worsened.",
            "8.On the following day, the deceased was referred to Busia County Hospital and eventually to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret where he passed away while undergoing treatment.A postmortem conducted by the pathologist, Dr. Kibet Keitanyi (PW 6) revealed that the deceased died from severe head injury.The postmortem report (Ex 1) indicated that the cause of death was severe head injury due to blunt force trauma consistent with assault.",
            "9.The report made by the deceased’s grandmother (PW 4) was received and booked by PC Everlyne Wambua (PW 5) who noted that the deceased appeared weak and had an injury on the head reportedly caused by the first and second accused. A P3 form was issued to the deceased but he was in serious state and was admitted to a local hospital at Kocholia before being referred to Busia hospital.",
            "10.Everlyne (PW 5) arrested and charged the two accused with the offence of grevious harm but after the death of the deceased at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital the charge was enhanced to that of murder after which necessary investigations were conducted by Sgt Samson Biwot (PW 7) who found that the deceased was assaulted and occasioned severe injury by the two accused. However, the alleged assault weapon was never recovered.",
            "11.Both accused denied the charge with the first accused stating in her defence that she arrived at her home only to find a group of children shouting and making noise while the deceased and Levin (PW 3) fought. She learnt that a dispute over a radio had taken place among the children while collecting sand at a nearby river. She told the children to return to their respective homes. Later, she learnt that the deceased had been hit on the head by her son, the second accused and that this happened while the second accused was protecting his brother called Davy from being beaten by the deceased.",
            "12.The first accused contended that she did not assault the deceased and attributed her predicament to a land dispute existing between her family and that of the deceased.On his part, the second accused indicated that he was aged fifteen (15) years old and schools in Kitale. He was with other children collecting sand at a river when a dispute arose over a radio. His brother, Davy, was in the process beaten by the deceased and others. Thereafter, Davy went home and he (accused two) followed him.",
            "13.The deceased and other children also followed them to their home while holding sticks with which they further assaulted Davy before turning to and assaulting him. He defended himself by hitting the deceased on the head using fists. His mother arrived at the scene and told the children to go to their homes although the deceased complained of being injured and asking for compensation.",
            "14After some days, police officers arrived at the homestead of the two accused and arrested them both. The second accused contended that he did not use any object but his fists to hit the deceased and that what happened to the deceased was accidental. He also contended that the first accused was not at the scene when the deceased was beaten.",
            "15.All the facts and evidence foregoing present each sides version of the events leading to the death of the deceased. What is however, not disputed is the fact that the deceased died from a fatal head injury inflicted upon him on the material date. The assault was an unlawful act committed against the deceased after he and his boyfriends engaged in a brawl over a radio. The brawl started at a river bank and escalated at or near the homestead of the two accused where the deceased received the head injury which later proved fatal.",
            "16.The big question and indeed the issue for determination is whether the fatal assault against the deceased was inflicted by the first accused or the second accused or both. There cannot be any doubt that the force used against the deceased was extremely excessive in the circumstances. A brawl which is a normal phenomenon among boys of more or less similar age was unfortunately turned into a criminal transaction after one of the boys (deceased) received a fatal head injury.",
            "17.The medical evidence provided by the doctor pathologist (PW 6) indicated clearly that the head injury was due to blunt force trauma due to assault such that the deceased developed complication which necessitated a sophisticated medical procedure to remove a blood clot. Unfortunately, the procedure failed and the deceased succumbed to the head injury.The evidence of Dickson (PW 1), Everlyne (PW 2) and Levin (PW 3) clearly and credibly indicated that it was the first accused who actually inflicted the fatal injury upon the deceased using a thick stick (weapon) which was not recovered by the police.",
            "18.Indeed, the evidence against the first accused strongly indicted and established that she interfered in a boy’s brawl in which her sons were involved not with a view to create peace and maintain harmony but to “punish” the deceased and other boys for daring to go after her sons Davy and Robinson (accused two). She showed absolute bias against the deceased whom she perceived to be the ring leader of those who followed her sons into her homestead and that explained why he (deceased) received the severest of the punishment. Her evidence in defence was clearly disputed by the prosecution evidence which showed that she was determined to use excessive force against the deceased even though the death of the deceased was the last thing on her mind.",
            "19.It was quite clear that in the efforts by the first accused to escape criminal culpability for the fatal injury caused to the deceased by herself she made an attempt almost successfully to transfer blame to the second accused who in a move which showed that he was being protective for his mother stated in his defence that his mother was not at the scene when the deceased was assaulted and implied that he was the person who inflicted the fatal head injury upon the deceased using his bare fit. In that regard, he made an attempt to disprove the existence of a thick stick (rungu) in the assault against the deceased.",
            "20.From this court’s observation of the second accused’s demeanor while testifying it was quite obvious and apparent that he was coached on what to state in court with a view to exonerating the first accused and place himself on the “frying pan” or in the position of the “chief operating officer” in the criminal transaction against the deceased.",
            "21.Although the second accused was in fact not the key offender in assaulting and fatally injuring the deceased, he aided and abetted the commission of the offence as was indicated by Dickson (PW 1) and Levin (PW 3). Both indicated that a blunt assault weapon (rungu) was brought to the scene by the second accused after he was instructed by the first accused to fetch it. That, the second accused also hit the deceased with the rungu after the first accused had done so. This action was akin to the slogan “we lead others follow”. Only in the case, it was the first accused leading and the second accused following.",
            "22.In sum, it is the finding of this court that the deceased was assaulted and occasioned fatal injury by both the first and second accused with the first accused being the leading and most notorious offender.However, as noted hereinabove, the last thing on the minds of the two accused was to cause death to the deceased. The circumstances of the case did not establish that the two accused while assaulting the deceased had the necessary intention to cause his death. They must however, be held criminally responsible for the consequences of their unlawful act.",
            "23.Ultimately, this court must find and hereby finds that the offence established against the two accused beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution is that of Manslaughter, contrary to S.202 (1) of the penal code rather than murder.Both accused are accordingly found guilty and convicted."

        "judgement": [
            "[1]The Appellant, Dennis Muthomi Murithi, was charged with the offence of stealing contrary to section 268 as read with section 275 of the Penal Code. The particulars were that on 10/7/2019 at about 1044 hours at Mwichiune market Igoki location in Imenti South Sub-County within Meru County, jointly with others not before court, he stole Ksh.88,102 (Eighty Eight Thousand, One Hundred and Two) the property of Stanley Gitonga Nkunja. He denied the charges but after a full trial, he was convicted and sentenced to 3 years imprisonment on 1/12/2020.",
            "[2]On appeal from conviction and sentence, the appellant has now appealed to this court against both the conviction and sentence raising 6 grounds as follows:1.The trial court’s conviction was against the weight of the evidence on record as there glaring discrepancies, contradictions and blatant falsehoods in the evidence tendered by the prosecution witnesses.2.The trial court erred in law and fact in holding that the appellant was guilty of the offence of stealing contrary to section 268 as read with section 275 of the Penal Code, yet the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.3.The trial court erred in law and fact in shifting the burden of proof to the appellant.4.The trial court erred in law and fact in holding that the appellant had not challenged the evidence of the prosecution witnesses.5.The trial court erred in law and fact in dismissing and/or failing to properly consider and apply the appellant’s defence before arriving at a conviction.6.The sentence of three (3) years imprisonment was manifestly excessive in the circumstances.",
            "[3]The respondent in its submissions filed on 22/12/2021 urged that it had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, as the evidence which was adduced by the prosecution witnesses was clear, consistent and corroborated, and relied on Daniel Muthami Sono v Republic (2019)eKLR. It denied the appellant’s allegation that the trial court had shifted the burden of proof to him, as the appellant was given ample time to cross examine the witnesses. It applauded the trial court for weighing the evidence of the prosecution against that of the appellant, and finding that the appellant stole from the complainant. It concluded that the sentence meted out to the appellant was per the law, taking into account the type of offence committed by the appellant and the amount stolen by him. It humbly prayed for the dismissal of the appeal and the conviction and the sentence of the trial court to be upheld.",
            "[4].This Court, being the first appellate court is aware of its duty to evaluate the entire evidence on record bearing in mind that it had no advantage of seeing the witnesses testify and observe their demeanor. (see Okeno v R (1972) EA 32).",
            "[5].PW1 Stanley Gitonga, the complainant herein, testified that he lived in Uruku and he was unknown to the appellant. On 30/6/2019, he lost his phone and in July, he went to replace the line 0792785212 at an Mpesa shop at Thingithu market. After doing the replacement, the line showed that it had no network so he went to customer care. He was informed that the line had been damaged and the money totaling to Ksh. 88,100 in his M-shwari(Mpesa account) had been withdrawn by one Kenneth Mutwiri. Kenneth Mutwiri, an Mpesa agent said that it was the appellant who had been sending and withdrawing money from his phone. Safaricom told him that the money was being withdrawn from Kenneth Mutwir’s agent outlet. The statement from Safaricom customer care showed that Kenneth was the recipient of the money. He reported the matter at Nkubu police station and the appellant was arrested.",
            "[6].On cross examination, he stated that he was unknown to the appellant prior to this case, and evidence from safaricom showed that it was the appellant who was sending money to Kenneth.",
            "[7].PW2 Evangeline Mugambi, the complainant’s employer, stated that she was unknown to the appellant. She paid the complainant a monthly salary of Ksh.8,000 via Mpesa. On 30/6/2019, the complainant informed her that his phone had been lost and/or stolen, and she advised him to report to the police. When the complainant went to replace the Sim card, the new Sim card had no network and he sought help from Safaricom customer care. At the safaricom customer care, the complainant was informed that his money had been withdrawn from his M-shwari at Kigane area by Kenneth and another and he was given the statement. She escorted the complainant to Nkubu police station and the appellant was arrested. The complainant lost Ksh.86,000 and the appellant fulizad Ksh. 2,000 using the complainant’s phone.",
            "[8].On cross examination, she stated that Safaricom issued a statement on how the money was withdrawn, and the investigations by the investigating officer connected the appellant to the theft.",
            "[9].PW3 Kenneth Mutwiri Festus, an agent of Mpesa namely Del Nel Systems, testified that he knew the appellant, because on 9/7/2019, the appellant had replaced a Sim card using an Identity card of Stanley Gitonga. The following day, the appellant came to withdraw Ksh.40,000 using a phone registered under the name of Stanley Gitonga. The appellant then borrowed on Fuliza Ksh.2,000 in the name of Stanley Gitonga. He then gave the appellant the Ksh.40,000, Ksh.1030 received from Carren and the Fuliza money. In the evening, the appellant came again to replace the line but he declined, and the appellant left. The following day, he informed customer care via the phone that the appellant had withdrawn Ksh.40,000. He was called by the CID officers and he gave them a mini-statement of Mpesa transaction. His phone number was 0792194920 and the appellant had forwarded Ksh.2000 from Stanley Gitonga Nkunja’s number 0792785212. It was the appellant who had the complainant’s phone and he did not see the complainant at any given time.",
            "[10].On cross examination, he affirmed that the appellant was the one who withdrew Ksh.40,000 using the complainant’s Identity Card, and the Fuliza transaction was that of the complainant. The appellant’s sister sent him Ksh.1030 in his phone and the appellant also borrowed Ksh.2000 on Fuliza facility.",
            "[11].PW4 PC Hezna Nyub of Nkubu Police Station took over the case and the investigations on 23/12/2019 from PC Kyallo who was on transfer. He stated that on 12/7/2019, the complainant reported how the appellant had stolen Ksh.88,102 from his mobile phone and transferred it to his(appellant’s) Mpesa account. The appellant first transferred Ksh. 40,000 then he borrowed Ksh.2,000 on Fuliza and, lastly, he transferred Ksh.45,500. They recorded the witness statements, obtained the Mpesa statement which showed the transaction and arrested the appellant on 16/7/2019. He produced the complainant’s Mpesa statement and statement of account of Kenneth Mutwiri as exhibits PEXB. 1 and 2, respectively.",
            "[12].On cross examination, he stated that the Mpesa statement showed that the appellant transferred the money from the complainant’s number. The appellant had used the Mpesa agent’s number and/or phone to fuliza the money and the Mpesa agent had also recorded a witness statement. The appellant did not transfer the money to his phone, but he sent it to a third party. The appellant transferred the money in bits and he did not know how the appellant had gotten the complainant’s details.",
            "[13].In his sworn defence, the appellant, DW1 vehemently denied committing the offence or taking the money. He was arrested when he went to collect money sent to him from an Mpesa shop, using someone’s phone. The money was for his medication and he prayed for leniency because he had never done such a thing in life.",
            "[14].On cross examination, he stated that he was at the material time aged 29 years and the money had been sent on Mpesa. He went to PW3’s shop, did a replacement of the line and withdrew the money.",
            "[15].The issues for determination are whether the ingredients of the offence of stealing were proved beyond reasonable doubt; whether the evidence by the prosecution witnesses was contradictory and false thus rendering the conviction unsafe; whether the appellant’s defence was considered; and whether the sentence was manifestly excessive.",
            "[16].Section 268 (1) of the Penal Code states as follows:-“A person who fraudulently and without claim of right takes anything capable of being stolen, or fraudulently converts to the use of any person, other than the general or special owner thereof, any property, is said to steal that thing or property.”",
            "[17].In this case, the appellant, used the complainant’s Identity Card at PW3’s Mpesa shop in order to replace a Sim card he knew very well was not his. Soon thereafter, the appellant without any claim of right, proceeded to withdraw Ksh.40,0000 from the complainant’s M-shwari (Mpesa) account. He then transferred Ksh.2,000 to PW3 and Ksh.45,500 to Geoffrey Mbuga Mucege. After collecting the money from PW3, the appellant left only to return in the evening with a view of doing a second replacement of the complainant’s line, which PW3 declined to perform.",
            "[18].In his sworn defence, the appellant admitted that he used someone else’s phone number to withdraw the money. He also admitted on cross examination that he had gone to PW3’s shop and done a replacement of a safaricom line. The Safaricom statement of account for the complainant shows that on 10/7/2019 at 10.17 am, Ksh.50 was deposited into the complainant’s Mpesa account. At 10.36 am, Ksh.2,000 was withdrawn from the complainant’s M-shwari account. At 10.38 am, Ksh.86,000 was withdrawn from the complainant’s M-shwari account bringing the Mpesa balance to Ksh.88,102.26. At 10.44 am, Ksh.40,000 was withdrawn from the complainant’s phone at PW3’s Mpesa shop. At 10.46 am, Ksh. 2,000 was transferred to PW3’s phone bringing the total Mpesa balance to Ksh.45,832.26. At 11.00 am, Ksh.45,500 was transferred to Geoffrey Mbuga Mucege bringing the Mpesa balance to Ksh.291.26.",
            "[19].The complainant testified that he lost his phone on 30/6/2019 and when he went to replace the Sim card in July, he discovered that Ksh.88,100 was missing from his M-shwari and/or Mpesa account. When he went to the service provider to get the Mpesa statement, he was informed that the money had been withdrawn from his phone by the appellant. The complainant’s testimony was corroborated by PW2 and PW3. The investigating officer, PW4 testified that the appellant transferred the money from PW1’s phone in bits to a third party.",
            "[20].This court finds that the appellant, without any claim of right, withdrew Ksh. 40,000 which was something capable of being stolen, from the complainant’s Mpesa account. The appellant still without any claim of right, transferred from the complainant’s Mpesa account, Ksh.47,500 which was something capable of being stolen, to PW3 and Geoffrey Mbuga Mucege.",
            "[21].The evidence of the complainant was consistent with that of PW2 and PW3. PW3, who was well known to the appellant prior to this incident, affirmed on cross examination that it was the appellant who had withdrawn the money using the complainant’s Identity Card. It is clear from the court record that the complainant had not sent the appellant to withdraw money from his phone on his behalf. The only inference that can be drawn from the appellant’s possession of the complainant’s Identity Card, which he subsequently used to withdraw the complainant’s money, is that he had stolen it.",
            "[22].The appellant was well known to PW3 and the Mpesa statements linked him to the offence. This court is satisfied that it was the appellant who stole the complainant’s money, and therefore the prosecution proved all the ingredients of the offence of stealing, within the meaning of section 268 of the Penal Code, beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence led by the prosecution witnesses was consistent and corroborated, and, therefore, the appellant’s conviction by the trial court was safe.",
            "[23].The appellant’s contention that his defence was not considered has no merit. His defence was a bare denial of either committing the offence or taking the money. The appellant albeit admitting going to the Mpesa shop to collect money which was allegedly sent to him, doing a replacement of a safaricom line and using someone else’s phone number to withdraw the money, still insisted that he was innocent of the charge of theft. He faults the trial court for shifting the burden of proof to him.",
            "[24].It well settled that in criminal law, save in exceptional circumstances, the burden of proof always lies with the prosecution to establish each and every ingredient that constitutes an offence preferred against an accused person. (See Woolmington v DPP [1935] UKHL).  Even if an accused person opts to keep quiet, the prosecution retains the legal burden to establish its case to the required standard of proof beyond any reasonable doubt.",
            "[25].Having read the trial court’s judgment, this court does not find that the trial court shifted the burden of proof to the appellant. The trial court after due consideration of the prosecution’s case alongside the appellant’s defence of plain denial, as a whole in accordance with method of Okethi Olale v. R (1964) EA 555, correctly found that the offence had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.",
            "[26].It is trite law that the sentencing rests at the discretion of a trial court and an appellate court should only interfere where the trial court misdirected itself on principle or the sentence is manifestly excessive so as to cause an injustice.  See Wanjema v. R (1971) EA 493, 494, where the Court of Appeal for East Africa held:“An appellate court should not interfere with the discretion which a trial court has exercised as to sentence unless it is evident that it overlooked some material factor, took int account some immaterial factor, acted on a wrong principle or the sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case. The instant sentence merits this court’s interference with it on each of these grounds. No account was taken, as it should have been, of the fact that the appellant pleaded guilty: Skone (1967) 51 Cr. App. R. 165 and Godfrey (1967) 51 Cr. App. TR. 449. This admits no doubt because the magistrate awarded maximum sentence to the first offender, which of itself is unusual).”",
            "[27].The Kenya Court of Appeal in Bernard Kimani Gacheru v Republic [2002] eKLR restated the principle as follows:“It is now settled law, following several authorities by this court and the High Court that sentence is a matter that rests in the discretion of the trial court. Similarly, sentence must depend on facts of each case. On appeal, the appellate court will not easily interfere with sentence unless, that sentence is manifestly excessive on the circumstances of the case, or the trial court overlooked some material factor, or acted on a wrong principle. Even if, the Appellate Court might itself have not passed that sentence and feels that the sentence is heavy these alone are not sufficient grounds for interfering with the discretion of the trial court on sentence unless, anyone of the matters already stated is shown to exist.”",
            "[28].Section 275 of the Penal Code provides for the general punishment for theft as follows:“Any person who steals anything capable of being stolen is guilty of the felony termed theft and is liable, unless owing to the circumstances of the theft or the nature of the thing stolen some other punishment is provided, to imprisonment for three years.”",
            "[29].During sentencing, the trial court, which had the advantage of observing the demeanor of the appellant, as noted in Okeno v R, said as follows:“I have considered the nature of the offence and mitigation of the accused. I have observed the demeanor of the accused. He is not remorseful at all. He does not regret his actions. In light of the above, I find that the accused deserves a deterrent sentence. The accused therefore sentenced to serve imprisonment for a period of three years.”",
            "[30].The sentence meted out to the appellant was within what was prescribed by the provisions of section 275 of the Penal Code. This Court would not interfere even if it might itself have passed a lesser (or greater) sentence. (see Gacheru v. R, supra). However, the trial court clearly erred in principle by failing to take into account the material factor that the accused was a first offender and, consequently, passed an excessive sentence to the prejudice of the appellant.",
            "[31].The Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa in Josephine Arissol v. R 1957 (EA) 447 at 449, in not so dissimilar circumstances of maximum penalty being imposed for a first offender held:“We have, however, come to the conclusion that the sentence of three year’s imprisonment, which is the maximum under the law for the offence of which she was convicted, is excessive. The appellant has hitherto been of excellent character, she is young and a first offender: all these are circumstances which normally are considered in mitigation of sentence. It is unusual to impose the maximum sentence on a first offender and it would be wrong to depart from that rule because, on the evidence, she might have been convicted for a greater offence.”",
            "[32].This court feels that it would be wrong to depart from the rule on account of failure by the accused, as observed by the trial court, to show remorse. The rule in Arissol that it is unusual to impose the maximum sentence on a first offender was reiterated in latter case of Wanjema v R, supra. In the present case, the court must find that the sentence was excessive in the circumstances as the trial court failed to take into account the fact that the accused was a first offender and also, thereby, erred on principle. This court is, on the test in Wanjema v. R supra, entitled to interfere with the sentencing discretion of the trial court.",
            "[33].In this case, failure to be remorseful and regret his actions of itself did not call for the maximum sentence of imprisonment for three years prescribed for the offence of theft under section 268 (1) as read with 275 of the Penal Code. This court considers that two thirds of the sentence would still have served the deterrent sufficiently to the satisfaction of the concern of the trial court that the accused was not remorseful at all.",
            "[34].Accordingly, for the reasons set out above, the Court makes the following Orders:1.The appellant’s appeal on conviction for the offence of theft contrary to section 268 as read with 275 of the Penal Code is dismissed.2.The appellant’s appeal on sentence is allowed, and pursuant to section 354 (3) (b) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the sentence of imprisonment for three years is set aside and substituted with a sentence of imprisonment for two (2) years from the date of sentence in the trial court.",
            "[35].The appellant has been in custody since sentence on 1/12/2020 which is a period of 1 year six months, which is more than required for a two-year imprisonment sentence, with 1/3 remission.",
            "[36].There shall, therefore, be an order, for the immediate release of the appellant unless his conduct in prison has disentitled him to the discretion of the Commissioner of Prisons to grant remission under section 46 of the Prisons Act, or he is otherwise lawfully held.Order accordingly."

            "6.Being dissatisfied with the Judgment, the Accused appealed to this court on the following grounds:i.That,the trial magistrate erred on the burden of proof.ii.That the trial magistrate erred on relying on the evidence of PW1 (the complainant) which was untruthful and not corroborated by the evidence of PW4.iii.That the trial magistrate erred on relying on the evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW3 without weighing the defence against the same.iv.Thatthe trial magistrate erred in law and fact by relying on a defective birth certificate of PW1 and no inference was made by any documentary evidence in respect of age assessment of PW1 thus arriving at a wrong sentence and conviction.v.Thatthe trial magistrate erred in casually disregarding the defence case.vi.Thatthe trial magistrate erred in law and fact by relying on the evidence of PW1, PW2, PW3 and PW4 which did not disclose the key ingredients of the offence of defilement notably age assessment, penetration and identification.vii.Thatthe trial magistrate erred in making inference which was not supported by evidence.viii.Thatthe trial magistrate erred in finding the appellant guilty of the offence before analysing the defence case.ix.Thatconsequently, the findings of the trial magistrate were bad in law and fact against the weight of the evidence.x.Thatthe sentence of 20 years was harsh and oppressive on the appellant and moreso when the age of PW1 was not ascertained.xi.That the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.",
            "7.It was the Prosecution’s case in the trial that the Accused defiled the minor F.C on 1st July 2018.

            "21.The Respondent submitted that the age of a victim in sexual offence was of paramount importance. That the birth certificate of the minor was produced and although the appellant challenged its authenticity, it was still a document that was recognized by the Government and it was obtained in the year 2017, way before this case began. It was the Respondent’s submission that there was no contradiction on the evidence of age between PW1 and PW3 as they lived closely with PW1. It was the Respondent’s further testimony that PW1 was a primary school pupil and could not have been over 18 years of age. That the best evidence in relation to age was a Birth Certificate.",

He said that he did not know the complainant and only got to know her in court. That his (Accused’s) family and that of C had a bad relationship due to the boundary dispute.",
            "30.DW2 (ES) testified that she was the Accused’s wife and that they lived together. That on the material day, in the company of DW1 they went to church and returned home at around 2pm. That they took lunch at around 5.30 pm and thereafter N came with some people to do wiring and fix the lights for them.",
            "31.It was DW2’s testimony that PW3 (VC) came and began raising the alarm that her child from Molo had been defiled. That it was not the first time she had said that. It was DW2’s testimony that they had not seen or noticed anything as no one had left their home since 5.30 pm. That the fundis finished and they ate supper at 8pm and Leonard saw them off.",
            "32.DW2 testified that DW1 called her the following day and informed her that he had been arrested. It was DW2’s testimony that PW3 was a neighbour and that she bought land from a neighbour. That they did not have a good relationship with her. It was DW2’s testimony that PW3 destroyed any fence they put up. It was DW2’s further testimony that she was with DW1 from 5.30 pm to 8. 30 p.m. and there was no way that he could have committed the offence. That DW1 was also with N and SS.",
            "33.DW3 (SS) testified that he was the brother to DW1. That on the material day, Nicholas came and they proceeded to DW1’s house to do wiring. It was his testimony that they installed the wires until around 7p.m. That C was also known as V, who was PW3.",
            "34.It was DW3’s testimony that PW3 began making noises and stated that DW1 should leave the land and houses. That there was a dispute between PW3 and DW1 where it was alleged that DW1 had assaulted PW3’s child. DW3 averred that DW1 did not commit the offence and that he did not know the victim.",
            "35.NK (DW4) testified that he was DW1’s neighbour. That on the material day, DW1 called him to do wiring in his house. That they went to DW1’s house together with DW3 and worked until 6.30 p.m. He testified that while he worked, he heard noises outside and upon inquiring what the noise was about, DW2 informed him that they had a boundary dispute with a neighbour and that the neighbour even quarrelled when chicken crossed over to her farm. That they later left DW1’s house and heard that he had been arrested the following day. He testified that DW1 could not have committed the defilement as he was with him the entire evening.",
            "36.The Appellant submitted that the case was not proved. He submitted that the contradictory evidence of PW1 and PW4 clearly showed that there was no penetration as PW4 would have observed a freshly broken hymen. That PW4 had stated in cross examination and re-examination that the hymen was broken a long time ago. The Appellant further submitted that PW4 had clarified that the infection on PW1’s vagina could not be solely attributed to sexual intercourse. That there was no spermatozoa found in the swab obtained from PW1. That therefore the prosecution failed to prove that there was penetration.",
            "37.The Appellant submitted that the defence evidence showed that on the material day, he was with DW2, DW3 and DW4 in his house. It was his further submission that the trial magistrate erred when she relied on the evidence of PW1, PW2, and PW3 without weighing it against the defence.",
            "38.It was the Appellant’s submission that the prosecution failed to call Caro, the woman who alleged to have come to the scene of crime and found PW1, whose evidence would have corroborated the evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW3. That they also failed to call Joan, the mother of PW2, EK and EK.",
            "39.The Appellant submitted that the trial court did not consider the bad blood between the Accused and PW3 over the boundary dispute which made PW3 instigate the present case to settle scores.",
            "40.On the age of the victim, the Appellant submitted that the trial court relied on a defective birth certificate. That PW3’s testimony regarding the age of PW1 was doubtful since she did not sire her and the prosecution failed to call either the father or mother to tender evidence on the age of PW1. It was the Appellant’s further submission that PW3 fraudulently obtained the birth certificate which was produced as a Photostat. That the birth certificate was not certified a true copy of the original and it therefore offended Sections 64 and 66 of the Evidence Act. He relied on the cases of Adam Daktari Konoye v Republic [2019] eKLR and Kaingu Elias Kasomo v Republic, Criminal Appeal Case No. 504 of 2010 to support his submissions.",
            "41.On Sentence, the Appellant submitted that the Sentence of 20 years was harsh and oppressive as the complainant may have been above 13 years.",
            "42.It was his final submission that the prosecution failed to prove the age of the complainant, penetration and identification of the Accused and consequently the conviction and sentence be quashed.",
            "43.This being the first appellate court, I have a duty to re-evaluate the evidence on record. The Court of Appeal in the case of Abok James Odera T/A A.J Odera & Associates v John Patrick Machira T/A Machira & CO. Advocates [2013] eKLR, restated this duty as follows: -“This being a first appeal, we are reminded of our primary role as a first appellate court namely, to re-evaluate, re-assess and reanalyse the extracts on the record and then determine whether the conclusions reached by the learned trial Judge are to stand or not and give reasons either way”.",
            "44.I have gone through and given due consideration to the Petition of Appeal dated 1st March 2021, the Appellant’s Written Submissions dated 18th November 2021 and the Respondent’s Written Submissions dated 28th February 2022. The following issues arise for my determination.(i)Whether the Prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.(ii)Whether the Defence places doubt on the Prosecution case.(iii)Whether the Sentence preferred against the Accused was manifestly excessive, harsh and severe.",
            "45.It is trite law that for the offence of defilement to be established, three ingredients being the age of the victim, penetration and positive identification or recognition of the offender must be proved.",
            "46.The Accused was charged with defilement contrary to section 8(1) as read with section 8(3) of the Sexual Offences Act No. 3 of 2006. Section 8 (1) of the Act states that any person who commits an act which causes penetration with a child is guilty of an offence of defilement. The Children’s Act no. 8 of 2001. A child is defined in the Children’s Act as any human being under the age of eighteen years.",
            "47.The importance of proving age was underscored by the Court of Appeal in the case of Hadson Ali Mwachongo v Republic [2016] eKLR, as follows: -“The importance of proving the age of the victim of defilement under the Sexual Offences Act by cogent evidence cannot be gainsaid. It is not in doubt that the age of the victim is an essential ingredient of the offence of defilement and forms an important part of the charge because the prescribed sentence is dependent on the age of the victim. In Alfayo Gombe Okello v Republic Cr. App 203 of 2009 (Kisumu) this Court stated as follows: -In its wisdom, Parliament chose to categorize the gravity of that offence on the basis of age of the victim, and consequently the age of the victim is a necessary ingredient of the offence which ought to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. This must be so because dire consequences flow from proof of the offence under section 8(1)”.",
            "48.PW3 produced a birth certificate (P.Exh1). The Birth Certificate indicated that PW1 was born on 6th July 2004 and that the name of the mother was VCM (PW3). The authenticity of the Birth Certificate was challenged by the Accused. He said that the name of the victim’s mother was at variance with PW3’s name. This discrepancy was explained by PW3 upon cross examination where she stated that she was not the real mother of PW1 but that PW1 was in her custody. She further stated that the parents of PW1 (A and RR) lived in Molo. She told the court that the victim was her cousin and was under her custody.",
            "49.I am not convinced by the authenticity of the Birth Certificate as it does not bear the names of the parents of the victim. It cannot be used to determine the age of PW1. However, it is uncontested that at the time of the incident, PW1 was a school going child. PW1 testified that she was a pupil at [particulars withheld] Primary School. PW1 confirmed the same upon cross examination and further stated that she was in class 8. From this set of facts, I am satisfied that while PW1 may not have been proven to be 13 years of age was definitely not above 18 years of age. She was a minor.",
            "50.Section 2 of the Sexual Offences Act defines penetration as the partial or complete insertion of genital organs into the genital organs of another person. In the case of EE v Republic [2015] eKLR, Riechi J. stated that: -“An important ingredient of the offence of defilement is that there must have been penetration. Penetration or act of sexual intercourse has therefore to be proved to sustain a charge of defilement”.",
            "51.With respect to proof, the Supreme Court of Uganda held in the case of Bassita vs. Uganda S.C. Criminal Appeal Number 35 of 1995, that: -“The act of sexual intercourse or penetration may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence. Usually, the sexual intercourse is proved by the victims own evidence and corroborated by the medical evidence or other evidence. Though desirable it is not a hard and fast rule that the victim’s evidence and medical evidence must always be adduced in every case of defilement to prove sexual intercourse or penetration. Whatever evidence the prosecution may wish to adduce, to prove its case, such evidence must be such that it is sufficient to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt”.",
            "52.PW4 who was the clinical officer produced treatment notes that were marked as P.Exh 4. He also produced and marked the P3 form and Post Rape Care Form as P. Exh 3 and P.Exh. 2 respectively. PW4 testified that he examined the complainant on 2nd July 2018 and found that she had a broken hymen which was not newly broken. He further testified that he conducted a urine analysis and found one or two pus cells. It was his finding that due to the broken hymen, there was defilement.",
            "53.Section C of the P3 form revealed the results of the examination that the hymen was broken but not fresh. PW4 testified that the hymen was not freshly broken. The Accused did not challenge the authenticity or the contents of the P3 form when he cross examined PW4.",
            "54.The Post Rape Care Form that was filled on the material day confirmed the findings contained in the P3 form. I am convinced on the strength of the evidence contained in the P3 form, Post Rape Care Form and the testimonies of PW1 and PW4 that there was penetration. The question however is whether penetration happened on the material date or earlier.",
            "55.PW4 testified that upon examining PW1, he found a broken hymen and it was his further finding that the hymen was not freshly broken. The same findings were contained in the P3 form and Post Rape Care Form. While I appreciate that there was evidence of penetration, there was no evidence that it happened on the material day.",
            "56.To bolster his defence, the Appellant submitted that there was no spermatozoa found in the vaginal swab obtained from PW1 which in his view meant that there was no penetration. I have no hesitation in dismissing both the ground of appeal and submission. This is because there is no mandatory requirement for DNA testing. In the case of Robert Mutungi Mumbi v Republic, Criminal Appeal Number 52/2014 [2015] eKLR the Court of Appeal held that:“Section 36 (1) of the Act empowers the Court to direct a person charged with an offence under the Act to provide samples for tests, including for DNA testing to establish linkage between the accused person and the offence. Clearly, that provision is not couched in mandatory terms. Decisions of this court abound which affirm the principle that medical or DNA evidence is not the only evidence by which commission of a sexual offence may be proved.”",
            "57.Furthermore, the law does not require the presence of spermatozoa as proof of penetration. The Court of Appeal in the case of Mark Ouiruri v Republic (2013) eKLR, expressed itself on this matter as follows: -“…… and the effect that the medical examination was carried out on her on 16th November 2008, five days after the event, and that during that time she must have taken a bath and no spermatozoa could be found. In any event, the offence is against penetration of a minor and penetration does not necessarily end in the release of sperms into the victim. Many times the attacker does not fully complete the sexual act during commission of the offence. That is the main reason why the law does not require that evidence of spermatozoa be availed. So long as there is penetration whether only on the surface, the ingredient of the offence is demonstrated, and the penetration need not be deep inside the girl’s organ….”",
            "58.Clarity on this issue was given by the Court of Appeal even prior to the enactment of the Sexual Offences Act (2006) in the case of Benjamin Mwangi & Another v Republic [1984] eKLR, where the Court rendered itself as follows:“The presence of spermatozoa alone in a woman’s vagina is not conclusive proof that she has sexual intercourse nor is absence of spermatozoa in her vagina proof of the contrary. What is required to prove that sexual intercourse has taken place is proof of penetration, an essential fact of the offence of rape.”",
            "59.With regard to the issue of identification, the Court of Appeal in the case of Cleophas Wamunga v Republic [1989] eKLR expressed itself as follows:“Evidence of visual identification in criminal cases can bring about miscarriage of justice and it is of vital importance that such evidence is examined carefully to minimize this danger. Whenever the case against a defendant wholly depends or to a great extent on the correctness of more identifications of the accused which he alleges to be mistaken, the court must warn itself of the special need for caution before convicting the defendant in reliance on the correctness of the identification”.",
            "60.The English case of R v Turnbull 1977] QB 224 is useful in this regard:“If the quality (of identification evidence) is good and remains good at the close of the accused’s case, the danger of mistaken identification is lessened; but the poorer the quality, the greater the danger. In our judgment when the quality is good, as for example when the identification is made after a long period of observation, or in satisfactory conditions by a relative, a neighbour, a close friend, a workmate and the like, the jury can safely be left to assess the value of the identifying evidence even though there is no other evidence to support it; provided always, however that an adequate warning has been given about the special need for caution”.",
            "61.In the present case, PW1 testified that the Accused was the person who defiled her. She further testified that she knew the Accused as a neighbour and that she saw him well on the material day. The court record also noted that PW1 identified the Accused in court. It was clear that PW1’s evidence was more of recognition than identification. In this respect, I draw guidance from the case of Peter Musau Mwanza v Republic [2008] eKLR, where the Court of Appeal expressed itself as follows: -“We do agree that for evidence of recognition to be relied upon, the witness claiming to recognise a suspect must establish circumstances that would prove that the suspect is not a stranger to him and thus to put a difference between recognition and identification of a stranger. He must show, for example, that the suspect has been known to him for sometime, is a relative, a friend or somebody within the same vicinity as himself and so he had been in contact with the suspect before the incident in question. Such knowledge need not be for a long time but must be for such time that the witness, in seeing the suspect at the time of the offence, can recall very well having seen him earlier on before the incident. It is not clear whether that is what Mr. Mutuku refers to as basis for recognition.”",
            "62.The remaining prosecution witnesses did not witness the defilement though the testimony of PW2 placed the Accused near the crime scene. PW2 testified that PW1 had told her that the Accused had been chasing her while asking for a memory card. As they were talking the Accused arrived and pulled PW1. It was her testimony that she followed the Accused and PW1 together with EK and EK. That the Accused threatened to beat her if she did not return home. It is salient to note that PW2 identified the Accused as a neighbour.",
            "63.I am satisfied that the Accused was properly identified by PW1 and PW2. He was also placed on the scene by PW2. The evidence of recognition by PW1 and PW2 was sufficient and of good quality as they both identified the Accused as a neighbour and also identified him in court.",
            "64.The evidence described above is circumstantial. The two minors EK and EK though not called as witnesses went to call PW2 and upon responding, PW2 found the victim standing without shoes near the nappier grass with her biker in her hand and PW1 immediately told her that she had been defiled by the Appellant. In the absence of corroborative medical evidence of recent penetration, the evidence falls short of proof of penetration. The evidence however disclose a lesser offence of attempted defilement provided under Section 9(1) of the Sexual Offences Act.",
            "65.The Accused denied committing the offence of defilement. He stated that on the material day, he was at home with this wife (DW2), SS and DW4. That electrical work was being done in his home till late in the evening i.e. 7pm and that there was no way he could have defiled PW1. He further stated that they had a land boundary dispute with CC and that was the basis of this accusation.",
            "66.DW2 corroborated what DW1 had testified. DW3 who was DW1’s brother stated that on the material day, he was with DW1 as wire installation was being done in his home. It was DW3’s testimony that C was also known as V. That there was a dispute between Veronica and DW1 regarding chicken and mbuzi that went to Veronica’s land to destroy his plants. DW4 testified that he was with DW1 on the material day till late in the evening and there was no way he would have committed the offence. It was his testimony that he heard from DW2 that they heard a boundary dispute with a neighbour he did not identify.",
            "67.First, let me address the purported boundary dispute between DW1 and CCM. There was no evidence fronted by DW1, DW2, DW3 and DW4 to back up these claims. It emerged from the testimony of DW3 that CCM was also known as V who testified as PW3 He also stated that the dispute between DW1 and V was that DW1’s mbuzi and chicken trespassed into V’s land and destroyed her crops. There was no mention of a boundary dispute in DW3’s testimony. It was notable that PW6 who was the Investigating Officer, upon cross examination stated that she did not find any land dispute between the Accused and PW3.",
            "68.It is my finding that the defence of an existence of a boundary dispute was an afterthought. The explanations put forward by the Accused and his three witnesses were insufficient, contradictory and without basis. This defence did not cast doubt on the prosecution case.",
            "69.The Accused raised an alibi defence by stating that he was at home with DW2, Stacy Sigei and DW4. His wife (DW2) and DW4 supported his alibi. Alibi is defined in the Black’s Law Dictionary, 10th Edition as:“A Defence based on the physical impossibility of a defendant’s guilt by placing the defendant in a location other than the scene of the crime at the relevant time”.",
            "70.The principle has long been accepted that an accused person who wishes to rely on a defence of alibi must raise it at the earliest opportunity to afford the prosecution an opportunity to investigate the truth or otherwise of the alibi. In Republic v Sukha Singh S/O Wazir Singh & Others [1939] 6 EACA 145, the former Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa held that:“If a person is accused of anything and his defence is an alibi, he should bring forward that alibi as soon as he can because, firstly, if he does not bring it forward until months afterwards there is naturally a doubt as to whether he has not been preparing in the interval, and secondly, if he brings it forward at the earliest possible moment it will give prosecution an opportunity of inquiring into that alibi and if they are satisfied as to its genuineness proceedings will be stopped”.",
            "71.It is trite that once a Respondent raises an alibi defence, the onus is on the prosecution to displace the defence of alibi after the defence raises it at the trial. This was held in the Court of Appeal case of Victor Mwendwa Mulinge v Republic [2014] eKLR as:“It is trite law that the burden of proving falsity, if at all, of an accused‘s defence of alibi lies on the prosecution”.The Court of Appeal in the case of Wang’ombe v Republic [1980] KLR 149 held as follows:“……. In Ssentale v Uganda [1968] EA 365, 368 (Sir Udo Udoma CJ)…. said that a prisoner who puts forward an alibi as an answer to a charge does not thereby assume any burden of proving that answer; it is a misdirection to refer to any burden as resting on the prisoner in such a case; for the burden of proving his guilt remains throughout the prosecution. We agree, we have ourselves said so on more than one occasion. . . .The defence of alibi was put forward for the first time some four months after the robbery when the appellant made his unsworn statement in court. Even in such circumstances the prosecution or the police ought to check and test the alibi wherever possible”.",
            "72.In this case I note that this defence of alibi was raised at the defence hearing and not at the beginning of the trial. Besides, it did not shake the prosecution evidence which clearly placed the Appellant at the scene. It is my finding that the defence of alibi fails as I consider it an afterthought. Indeed the entire defence did not cast doubt on the prosecution case.",
            "73.The court is granted power to convict on a lesser charge where the evidence so discloses even if an accused was not charged with it. Section 179 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code states that: -“When a person is charged with an offence and facts are proved which reduce it to a minor offence, he may be convicted of the minor offence although he was not charged with it”.",
            "74.In this case, I have come to the conclusion that the evidence discloses the lesser charge of attempted defilement. I substitute the initial charge of defilement with that of attempted defilement under section 9(1) as read with section 9(2) of the Sexual Offences Act. The Appellant is convicted accordingly.",
            "75.Section 9(2) of the Act provides that: -(2)A person who commits an offence of attempted defilement with a child is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years.",
            "76.The applicable principles in considering sentence on appeal were restated by the Court of Appeal in Bernard Kimani Gacheru v Republic [2002] eKLR, in the following terms: -“It is now settled law, following several authorities by this court and the high court, that sentence is a matter that rests in the discretion of the trial court. Similarly, the sentence must depend on the facts of each case. On appeal, the appellate court will not easily interfere with sentence unless, that sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case, or that the trial court overlooked some material factor, or took into account the wrong material, or acted on the wrong principle. Even if, the appellate court feels that the sentence is heavy and that the appellate court might itself not have passed that sentence, these alone are not sufficient grounds for interfering with the discretion of the trial court on sentence unless, anyone of the matters already states is shown to exist”.",
            "77.I have considered the Appellant’s mitigation, in which he pleaded for leniency stating that he had young children who depended on him and that his youngest child was unwell. This court however would be failing in its duty if it did not avail children the protection of the law against those minded to prey on their innocence.",
            "78.In the final analysis, I set aside the conviction for the offence of defilement and enter a conviction for the offence of attempted defilement. I also set aside the Sentence of 20 years Imprisonment and substitute therefor a Sentence of 10 years’ Imprisonment. This Sentence shall run from the first date of conviction and sentence.",
            "79.Orders accordingly."

Failure to do so impacts on the overall period of detention which may result in an excessive punishment that is not proportional to the offence committed.7.11 In determining the period of imprisonment that should be served by an offender, the court must take into account the period in which the offender was held in custody during the trial.",

            "Applicant": "Amos Rotich",
            "Respondent": "Republic"
        },
        "judgement": [
            "1.The Applicant, Amos Rotich, is charged with the offence of murder contrary to Section 203 as read with Section 204 of the Penal Code. On 29th March, 2022, the Applicant entered a plea of not guilty to the charge. His application to be released on bond pending trial was opposed by the prosecution through an affidavit sworn on 1st April, 2022 by one of the investigating officers Sergeant Edward Oketch.",
            "2.According to Sergeant Oketch, the Applicant is a flight risk because he does not have a fixed place of abode as the family departed the family land after the alleged murder. The officer further avers that the Applicant previously escaped to Uganda where he worked as a herder and if admitted to bail he is likely to escape to Uganda. It is also the Respondent’s averment that the Applicant does not have a national identity card or any other identification documents hence it would be hard to trace him if he absconds Court while out on bail.",
            "3.The application for bail is additionally opposed on the ground that some of the key witnesses in the case are family members of the Applicant and there is a likelihood that he will interfere with the witnesses if released on bail. Lastly, the investigating officer avers that releasing the Applicant may result in the disruption of public order and security as had happened during the burial of the deceased as there is still tension between the neighbours and the Applicant’s family.",
            "4.Counsel for the Applicant made an oral response to the affidavit filed by the prosecution. Counsel submitted that the Applicant has family members residing in West Pokot County and he therefore has a fixed abode. On the claim that the Applicant is a security risk, counsel submitted that bail should not be curtailed by other factors such as the security of the Applicant’s family members. Counsel also submitted that the Applicant is not a threat to the security of witnesses as alleged by the prosecution and urged the Court to admit the Applicant to reasonable bond terms.",
            "5.The Respondent’s reply was that the grounds raised in opposition to the Applicant’s application for bail are supported and anchored on Section 123 of the Criminal Procedure Code as well as the Bail and Bond Policy Guidelines. The Respondent further submitted that the pre-bail report filed on 9th May, 2022 also confirmed the averments of the investigating officer.",
            "6.In the pre-bail report filed by J. Maina, a probation officer, on 9th May, 2022, it is stated that the victim was a paternal aunt to the Applicant. The report also indicates that the Applicant had good relationship with the members of the community save for his alcohol consumption. It is further stated that the Applicant’s family was kicked out of their home when the offence was committed hence there are security concerns about his safety should he be released at this moment in time. The Applicant’s parents are also said to be opposed to his release on bail for fear that he might escape to Uganda. Finally, the report indicates that there are still security concerns about the Applicant’s safety as members of his extended family are still bitter that he committed the offence against one of their own.",
            "7.Article 49(1)(h) of the Constitution guarantees the right of an arrested person “to be released on bond or bail, on reasonable conditions, pending a charge or trial, unless there are compelling reasons not to be released.” Therefore, the only issue in the matter before me is whether the prosecution has demonstrated compelling reason(s) as to why the Applicant should not be released on bond or bail.",
            "8.Section 123A (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code provides the factors to be taken into consideration in determining an application for bail. Those factors are the nature or seriousness of the offence; the character, antecedents, associations and community ties of the accused person; the defendant's record in respect of the fulfillment of obligations under previous grants of bail; and, the strength of the evidence. According to Sub-Section (2) of the same Section, an accused person can only be denied bail if he has previously been granted bail and failed to surrender to custody or if it is necessary for him to be kept in custody for his own protection.",
            "9.In Waititu v Republic [2021] KESC 11 (KLR), the Supreme Court set down the factors to be considered in determining a bond or bail application as follows:“i.The nature of the charges;ii.The strength of the evidence which supports the charge;iii.The gravity of the punishment in the event of conviction;iv.The previous criminal record of the accused, if any;v.The probability that the accused may not surrender himself for trial;vi.The likelihood of the accused interfering with witnesses or may suppress any evidence that may incriminate him;vii.The likelihood of further charges being brought against the accused;viii.The probability of guilty;ix.Detention for the protection of the accused;x.The necessity to procure medical or social report pending final disposal of the case.”",
            "10.The Kenyan Judiciary’s Bail and Bond Policy Guidelines issued in March, 2015 at pages 16 to 19 provides the factors to be considered in deciding an application for bail or bond as follows:“(a)The nature of the charge or offence and the seriousness of the punishment to be meted if the accused person is found guilty.(b)The strength of the prosecution case.(c)Character and antecedents of the accused person.(d)The failure of the accused person to observe bail or bond terms on previous occasions is a good ground for denying bail or bond.(e)Likelihood of interfering with witnesses.(f)The need to protect the victim or victims of the crime from the accused person.(g)The relationship between the accused person and potential witnesses.(h)Child offenders.Where the accused person is a minor, the denial of bail or bond is considered not to be in the best interests of the accused person, who is a minor.(i)The accused person is a flight risk.(j)Whether accused person is gainfully employed.The courts also consider the fact that an accused person is gainfully employed to enhance the likelihood that he or she will attend trial.(k)Public order, peace or security.Whether the release of an accused person will disturb public order or undermine public peace or security. Pretrial detention may be necessary to preserve public order where it is demonstrated that the public response to an offence is such that the release of the accused person would be likely to lead to a public disturbance.(l)Protection of the accused person.Whether pretrial detention is necessary to protect the accused person.”",
            "11.It is the prosecution’s case that the Applicant is a flight risk and does not have a fixed place of abode. The investigating officer further deposes that the Applicant does not have identification documents and in the event that he skips court, tracing him would be cumbersome. According to the Respondent, the pre-bail report confirms its fears that the Applicant may flee to Uganda if released on bond. The averments of the investigating officer were not rebutted by the Applicant and are thus taken to be truthful. The facts placed on record leads this Court to agree with the Respondent that the Applicant is a flight risk.",
            "12.The Respondent has also stated that the Applicant should not be released on bond on account of his own security. It is averred that there is still tension between the family of the Applicant and the neighbours which has forced the family of the Applicant to vacate their land. In response, counsel for the Applicant submitted that denying the Applicant bail on this ground would amount to convicting him before his case is heard. The evidence placed before the Court is that there is general fear expressed by the Applicant’s family that both their security and that of the Applicant would be endangered if he is released on bond. The fear is well-founded considering the fact that the family of the Applicant was evicted from their land by irate neighbours. Of course the ire is expected subside after some time but for now the risk to the Applicant’s life is a compelling reason for denying him bond.",
            "13.As is often stated, the right to bond is not an absolute right. It can be denied where the prosecution has advanced sufficient reasons for denying an accused person bond. The argument by counsel for the Applicant that denial of bond amounts to conviction without trial is therefore misplaced because the Constitution clearly recognizes that bond or bail can be denied for compelling reasons.",
            "14.Based on what has been stated in this ruling, I am convinced by the prosecution and do hold that there are compelling reasons for denying the Applicant bond at this period in time. The Applicant’s application for bond is therefore declined.",
            "15.The prosecution having succeeded in convincing this Court to deny the Applicant bond, it is only fair that the case be heard and determined on priority basis. The Respondent is therefore directed to call all of its witnesses on the hearing date."

            "1.This is a second appeal from the judgment of the Principal Magistrate’s Court at Nyahururu (C. K. Obara) delivered on 18th May 2010 in Criminal Case No. 1020 of 2007.",
            "2.The brief background is that the appellant was charged in the Principal Magistrate’s Court at Nyahururu in Criminal Case No. 1020 of 2007 with two counts of defilement and, in the alternative, committing an indecent act with a child. On the first count, the appellant was charged with the offence of defilement contrary to section 8(1) as read with section 8(2) of the Sexual Offences Act, 2006. The particulars of the offence were that on 7th April 2007 in Nyandarua District of the then Central Province, he intentionally committed an act which caused penetration with AMN (name withheld) a girl aged 6 (six) years. In the alternative, the appellant was charged with committing an indecent act with a child contrary to section 11(1) of the Sexual Offences Act, 2006. The particulars of the alternative charge were that, on the date and at the place aforesaid, the appellant intentionally committed an indecent act with AMN, a girl aged 6 years.",
            "3.On the second count, the appellant was charged with the offence of defilement contrary to section 8(1) as read with section 8(2) of the Sexual Offences Act, 2006. The particulars of the offence were that on 7th April 2007 in Nyandarua District of the then Central Province, he intentionally committed an act which caused penetration with DNN (name withheld) a child aged 3 ½ (three-and-a-half) years. In the alternative, the appellant was charged with committing an indecent act with a child contrary to section 11(1) of the Sexual Offences Act, 2006. The particulars of the alternative charge were that, on the date and at the place aforesaid, the appellant intentionally committed an indecent act with DNN, a girl aged 3 ½ years.",
            "4.From the evidence adduced at the trial by the prosecution, the two infant victims of the offences with which the appellant was charged were his own daughters.",
            "5.The appellant denied the two principal counts and the alternative charges, whereupon the matter proceeded to trial with the prosecution calling 5 witnesses.",
            "6.AMN, the 1st victim (PW1) told the trial court that, on the material day, their mother had gone to hospital leaving her with her father (the appellant) and her sister DNN (PW2); that her father took her to the sitting room and defiled her; that he blocked her mouth with a piece of cloth as he defiled her; that after the appellant defiled her, he turned on her younger sister (PW2), who was seated on a chair, and defiled her; that she cried out, but no-one came to their rescue. She concluded by stating that, when her mother returned, she told her what had happened, and they were both taken to hospital by both parents.",
            "7.PW2 stated that, on the material day, the appellant removed her dress and pants, and defiled her; and that she felt a lot of pain. Notably, their mother did not testify at the appellant’s trial.",
            "8.PW4 (Peter Nginyo), the Clinical Officer at Ol Kalau District Hospital, also testified and produced 2 Medical Examination Reports (P3 forms) prepared by Dr. Bingwa with whom he (PW4) had worked for 2 years before retirement. According to the P3 Forms, Dr. Bingwa had examined the two children on two different dates and prepared the two reports. PW2 was examined on 7th April 2007 while PW1 was examined on 10th April 2007.",
            "9.According to PW4, the medical examination reports showed that PW1 had scratch marks/bruises on the front side of her abdomen, which were about 3- 4 days old; that the probable weapon used was hand/finger nails; that on further examination on her genitalia, there was a tear on the perineum; that her hymen was broken and a yellowish discharge was noted; that high vaginal swab revealed presence of spermatozoa; and that the doctor recommended follow-up treatment and counselling.",
            "10.The medical examination on PW2 revealed that she was unkempt at the time of examination; that she had scratch marks on her back, and the bruises were old; that she had other bruises on her chest and abdomen, which were about 3-4 days old; that the external genitalia was normal; that her hymen was broken, and that there was a yellowish discharge from her vagina; and that a high vaginal swab revealed presence of spermatozoa and epithelial cells noted.",
            "11.PW5 (PC Robert Mutuku), the investigating officer, told the trial court that, on the material date at about 10.00pm, he was telephoned by one Jeremiah of [particulars withheld] Village who told him that someone had been apprehended by members of the public for having defiled his two children; that he (PW5) rushed to the scene in the company of PC Muriithi; that, on their way, they met the appellant who had been apprehended by members of the public together with the two children (AMN and DNN); that they went back to Ol Kalou Police Station, recorded their reports and took the two children to Ol Kalou District Hospital.According to him, the children were treated and discharged. They later returned to the station and recorded statements, whereupon they were issued with P3 Forms. Consequently, the appellant was charged with the two counts of the above-mentioned offences.",
            "12.In his defence, the appellant stated that the complainants’ mother (MW) left for her home on 20th February 2007 taking with her the two children and a toddler; that she stayed at her home for a period of 1 ½ months and returned on 3rd April 2007 without the three children; that she told him that she had gotten another man to marry her; that on 4th April 2007, the children were brought by his (the appellant’s) cousin; that on 5th April 2007 thugs broke into his house claiming that his wife had told them that he, the appellant, had raped his two children; that they tied him up; that, at the time, the children and their mother were at the children’s grandmother’s house; that on 7th April 2007 he was taken to Ol Kalou Police Station where he was accused of defiling the two children. He denied ever doing so.",
            "13.After the trial, the Hon. Resident Magistrate (C. K. Obara) delivered his judgment on 18th May 2010 thereby convicting the appellant. He sentenced him to life imprisonment.",
            "14.Aggrieved by the conviction and sentence, the appellant appealed to the High Court of Kenya at Nakuru. In its judgment in HCCCr Case No. 230 of 2010 delivered on 3rd August 2012, the High Court (W. Ouko, J. – as he then was) dismissed the appellant’s appeal and upheld the conviction and sentence meted by the trial court.",
            "15.Being further aggrieved, the appellant appealed to this Court on 5 grounds set out in his undated Memorandum of Appeal, which was subsequently revised to the 7 grounds set out in his undated, Supplementary Memorandum of Appeal filed on 25th October 2021. According to the appellant, the learned Judge erred in law in: upholding the conviction and sentence based on a defective and duplex charge sheet; not finding that the appellant’s constitutional rights were grossly infringed upon; upholding the conviction and sentence on reliance on inconsistent and incomplete prosecution evidence; not finding that the availed medical evidence was not satisfactory, but peace-meal; overlooking the non-availability of some very essential witnesses; not finding that the appellant was denied to cross-examine vital witnesses; and in not finding that the charges were tailored to suit the prosecution case.",
            "16.In support, the appellant filed undated written submissions on 25th October 2021 requesting the Court to allow his appeal. In response, learned State Counsel (Ms. Jacinta Kibiriu for the Director of Public Prosecutions), also filed written submissions dated 7th February 2022, which she highlighted orally, urging the Court to dismiss this appeal.",
            "17.This Court’s mandate on a second appeal is conferred by Section 361(1) (a) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which provides:“361 (1) A party to an appeal from a subordinate court may, subject to subsection (8), appeal against a decision of the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction on a matter of law, and the Court of Appeal shall not hear an appeal under this section—(a)on a matter of fact, and severity of sentence is a matter of fact.”",
            "18.The jurisdiction of this Court on a second appeal, as is the case here, has been the subject of judicial pronouncements in various cases, such as Stephen M'Irungi& Another v Republic [1982-88] 1 KAR p.360 where it was held:“Where a right of appeal is confined to questions of law only, an appellate court has loyalty to accept the findings of fact of the lower court(s) and resist the temptation to treat findings of fact as holdings of law or mixed finding of fact and law, and, it should not interfere with the decisions of the trial or first appellate court unless it is apparent that, on the evidence, no reasonable tribunal could have reached that conclusion, which would be the same as holding the decision is bad in law.\"",
            "19.We also agree with what this Court had to say in Samuel Warui Karimi v Republic [2016] eKLR:“This is a second appeal and this Court has stated many times before, it will not normally interfere with concurrent findings of fact by the two courts below unless such findings are based on no evidence, or are based on a misapprehension of the evidence, or the courts below are shown demonstrably to have acted on wrong principles in making the findings. See Chemangong -vs- R, [1984] KLR 611.”",
            "20.Having carefully considered the proceedings at the trial court, the record of appeal in the High Court and in this Court, the grounds on which that appeal and the appeal before us are based together with the respective submissions of the parties, we find nothing in the proceedings before the two courts below to suggest that the concurrent findings of fact in the two courts were based on either no evidence or on misapprehension of evidence. Neither do we find anything to lead to the conclusion that the trial court and the High Court acted on wrong principles in making the findings of evidence leading to the appellant’s conviction and sentence, and the subsequent decision to dismiss his first appeal. Accordingly, there is nothing on record to warrant our interference with the lower courts’ concurrent findings of fact. In view of the foregoing, we confine ourselves to the points of law raised in this appeal.",
            "21.Turning to the first ground on which his appeal is anchored, the appellant’s case is that the High Court upheld his conviction and sentence based on “a defective and duplex charge sheet.” Even though the appellant raised no issue before the trial court relating to the alleged defects in the charge sheet, the trial Magistrate noted, of his own motion, that –“… section 8(2) of the Sexual Offences Actwas not incorporated in the charge sheet and also the second charge is framed as an offence under the Sexual Offences Act, 2007. Which Act does not exist.However, I will treat the same as an oversight which should not be a major influence on my ultimate decision.” (sic)",
            "22.In the appellant’s submission, the charge sheet on the basis of which he was charged, tried, convicted and sentenced was defective. Be that as it may, the defect, if any, was curable under Section 382 of the Criminal Procedure Code. It is also noteworthy that the defect complained of was by no means fatal. On the first appeal, the learned Judge had this to say of the matter:“The fact that sub-section (2) of section 8 of the Sexual Offences Actwas not cited in the charge sheet was not fatal. Similarly reference to Sexual Offences Act, 2007 in the second count instead of 2006 is of no consequence.”",
            "23.Indeed, the two counts of the charge against the appellant should have been stated as “defilement contrary to section 8(1) as read with section 8(2) of the Sexual Offences Act, 2006.” The pertinent question is what effect (if any) such a defect has on the proceedings. In answer to this question, section 382 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides in part:“Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained, no finding, sentence or order passed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered on appeal or revision on account of an error, omission or irregularity in the complaint, summons, warrant, charge, proclamation, order, judgment or other proceedings before or during the trial or in any inquiry or other proceedings under this Code, unless the error, omission or irregularity has occasioned a failure of justice ….”",
            "24.In the same vein, the Supreme Court of India in Willie (William) Slaney v State of Madhya Pradesh [A.I.R. 1956 Madras Weekly Notes 391], held that:“Whatever the irregularity, it is not to be regarded as fatal unless there is prejudice. It is the substance that we must seek. Courts have to administer justice and justice includes the punishment of guilt just as much as the protection of innocence. Neither can be done if the shadow is mistaken for the substance and the goal is lost in the labyrinth of insubstantial technicalities.”",
            "25.Having considered the record of appeal, the submissions of the parties and the afore-cited authorities on the ground in issue, we are of the considered view that no failure of justice occurred in this case merely in consequence of failure to cite on the charge sheet the correct subsection of the section under which the appellant was charged. Neither was it consequential to cite the Act as of 2007 instead of 2006. It would be far-fetched to conclude that any prejudice was occasioned at the trial by the defect or irregularity complained of. We agree with the decisions of the two courts below that the defect complained of was inconsequential and, accordingly, this ground of appeal fails.",
            "26.On the second ground, the appellant faults the two courts below for not finding that the appellant’s constitutional rights were “grossly infringed upon.” According to him, the learned Judge erred in law and in fact in failing to find that he (the appellant) was detained longer than prescribed by law. He cites Article 49(1) (f) of the Constitution, which reads:“49.(1)An arrested person has the right—(f)to be brought before a court as soon as reasonably possible, but not later than—(i)twenty-four hours after being arrested; or(ii)if the twenty-four hours ends outside ordinary court hours, or on a day that is not an ordinary court day, the end of the next court day …”",
            "27.We hasten to observe that the afore-cited provision of the Constitution, having come into force on 27th August 2010, did not apply to the appellant, who was arrested and charged in April 2007. The uncontested fact is that the appellant was arrested on 7th April 2007 and charged in court five days later on 11th April 2007. Be that as it may, this complaint was not raised before the trial court for consideration, but was introduced for the first time as a ground in his Petition of Appeal to the High Court. While the complaint may constitute a legitimate cause of action in separate civil proceedings, suffice it for the moment to observe that such a complaint cannot be the subject of determination on second appeal to this Court, on a point of law, unless it was also the subject of the trial and appeal in the two courts below.",
            "28.When faced with a similar issue in the case of Alfayo Gombe Okello v Republic [2010] eKLR this Court held:“… the issue was not raised since the trial began and was only raised for the first time in this second appeal. The appellant gave no reason for failure to do so earlier. We must therefore find, and we now do so, that it was not raised at the earliest opportunity although it could and should have.”",
            "29.Even if that ground were to hold, it cannot be a basis for acquittal. This Court in Fappyton Mutuku Ngui vs. Republic [2014] eKLR held that –“The correct position in law was set out in Julius Kamau Mbugua v Republic (2010) eKLR where the Court stated that the violation of the appellant’s right to be produced in court within twenty-four hours would not automatically result in his acquittal. Instead, the appellant would be at liberty to seek remedy, in damages, for the violation of his constitutional rights.”",
            "30.Thirdly, the appellant’s case is that he was convicted on inconsistent and incomplete prosecution evidence. While this Court is not obligated to re- examine and re-evaluate the nature and weight of evidence on which the appellant was convicted, we are nonetheless inclined to examine whether the prosecution had discharged its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which in itself would beg for answers as to: whether there was evidence that the appellant was responsible for the offences with which he was charged; whether there was evidence of penetration; and whether there was evidence that the children, who were his daughters, were below the age of 11 years.",
            "31.The learned State counsel submitted that the Court only needs to satisfy itself as to the ingredients of defilement, namely: penetration; the victims’ age; and whether the appellant was the perpetrator (see SKM v Republic [2021] eKLR). Having carefully considered the record of appeal, we find nothing to fault the findings of the two courts below that the three ingredients of defilement had been proved to the required standard. The two self-explanatory medical reports produced by PW4 proved penetration. The broken hymen, bruises and presence of spermatozoa on the two children’s genitalia told it all.Neither were their tender ages contested. They were aged 6 and 3 ½ years respectively.",
            "32.As to the identity of the perpetrator, the testimonies of the two children left no doubt in the mind of the trial court and of the learned Judge that their father (the appellant) was responsible for their ordeal. They immediately told their mother what had happened to them on her return home that same day. Their report to PW5 on the same day was consistent with what they told their mother on that very day. So were their recorded statements and subsequent testimonies at the trial. Accordingly, we find nothing that would lead to the conclusion that the appellant had been convicted on inconsistent and incomplete evidence. Similarly, his appeal on this ground cannot stand.",
            "33.The appellant’s fourth ground of appeal that the medical evidence was unsatisfactory and peace-meal is, in our considered view, insufficient to warrant departure from the findings of the two courts below. According to him, “… PW4 was not qualified to produce medical evidence where he never participated in the treatment nor examination of the alleged victims further, the appellant was not subjected to any examination as the law demands.” [sic]",
            "34.It is noteworthy that besides lamenting in his defence that “… the doctor who examined the complainants never examined [him] to ascertain if [he] was involved,” he did not object to PW4’s qualification. In any event, PW4 only produced medical examination reports prepared by a doctor, who was well known to him, and with whom he had worked for two years before he (the doctor) retired. . Indeed, PW4’s unshaken testimony was based on the P3 form and treatment notes prepared by that medical doctor. Notably, the appellant did not allege that the medical doctor by whom the medical reports on PW1 and PW2 were prepared was not qualified to examine them and report on their respective conditions in proof of penetration. His only complaint is that he was not examined by the same doctor who treated the victims to ascertain whether he was the perpetrator of the offence in issue. However, there are other ways of establishing the identity of the perpetrator of such an offence as the one with which the appellant was charged.",
            "35.In so far as the appellant’s identity as disclosed by his two daughters was not in doubt, we find nothing to fault the two courts below in their findings that he was the perpetrator of the offence against the two children. In our considered view, it did not require any scientific evidence or medical examination of any kind to corroborate the testimonies of his two daughters as to the identity of the person who defiled them, and in proof of the third ingredient of the offence of defilement. Accordingly, his appeal on this ground fails.",
            "36.On his fifth ground of appeal, the appellant laments what he views as the two courts’ alleged “overlooking of some very essential witnesses.” According to him, the victims’ mother should have been called as a witness to corroborate the charges against him. We do not agree. There is no statutory requirement for such corroboration as long as the trial court forms the view that the victim’s testimony is truthful. We say so mindful of the proviso to section 124 of the Evidence Act, Revised 2014 [1989], which reads:“… where in a criminal case involving a sexual offence the only evidence is that of the alleged victim of the offence, the court shall receive the evidence of the alleged victim and proceed to convict the accused person if, for reasons to be recorded in the proceedings, the court is satisfied that the alleged victim is telling the truth”",
            "37.With regard to the appellant’s submission that certain “essential” witnesses, such as the victims’ mother and one Jeremiah, the members of public who arrested him, and the victims’ grandmother, were not called to testify, we can only say that the prosecution calls those witnesses it considers necessary to support the charge. Article 50(2) of the Constitution provides that “every accused person has the right to a fair trial,” which includes the right “… (k) to adduce and challenge evidence.” Indeed, the appellant was at liberty to call any witness in his defence, including those he contends should have been called to testify at his trial.",
            "38.This Court is alive to the fact that there is no legal requirement in law on the number of witnesses required to prove any particular fact. That is the essence of Section 143 of the Evidence Act, which provides that “no particular number of witnesses shall, in the absence of any provision of law to the contrary, be required for the proof of any fact.” In Keter vs. Republic [2007] 1 EA p.135, the court held inter alia that:“The prosecution is not obliged to call a superfluity of witnesses, but only such witnesses as are sufficient to establish the charge beyond any reasonable doubt.”",
            "39.The appellant’s sixth ground of appeal is that he was “… denied to cross- examine vital witnesses.” We do not find that to be the case. As the learned Judge observed:“… the appellant actively participated in the trial cross-examining the witnesses, making applications for adjournment, to be taken to the hospital and even submitted in Kiswahili at the close of his defence.”",
            "40.How, then, can it be said that the appellant was denied the opportunity to cross-examine any of the witnesses who testified for the prosecution? We can only conclude that the appellant is intent on raising just about any issue he considers weighty in support of his appeal. However, this is not one of them. The appellant was at liberty to cross-examine at will any of the witnesses who testified at the trial as he did. He chose not to cross-examine some of them, but that is not to say that he was barred from doing so. He was not.",
            "41.Finally, the appellant contends that the charges against him were tailored to suit the prosecution case. Suffice it to observe that the prosecution sets out to call evidence in proof of the charge or charges against an accused. It follows, therefore, that the prosecution did no more than accomplish its statutory duty by calling evidence in proof of the charges against the appellant. That it succeeded in doing so is not sufficient to fault its role in the trial.",
            "42.Having considered the record of appeal before us, the judgments of the two courts below, the grounds on which the appeal before us is made, the written submissions of the appellant and the written and oral submissions of learned State counsel, we find that the appellant’s appeal herein on both conviction and sentence fails and the same is hereby dismissed in its entirety. Orders accordingly."

        "judgement": [
            "1.This is a first appeal from the judgment of the High Court of Kenya at Nakuru. The two appellants, David Silale Okeria and Francis Oyie Lemori, were charged before that court with the offence of murder contrary to Section 203 as read with Section 204 of the Penal Code, particulars being that on 23rd March, 2008 at Kotorongot village in the then Koibatek District they jointly murdered Robert Ouko Oliech, hereinafter referred to as the deceased. The prosecution called 8 witnesses in support of its case, the appellants defended themselves, and in a judgment delivered by Anyara Emukule, J. on 13th June, 2014 the appellants were convicted and sentenced in a ruling dated 10th October, 2014 to serve 30 years’ imprisonment from the date of their arrest and detention.",
            "2.Although we are required in a first appeal like this one to re-evaluate the evidence and come to our own conclusions of facts (Okeno v Republic [1972] EA 32),always remembering that we do not have the benefit of seeing or hearing the witnesses an advantage the trial Judge had, we may not have to dwell much into that because of the position the appellants have taken in this appeal.",
            "3.In similar Memoranda of Appeal, the appellants state that they did not plead guilty at the trial and in ground 2 it says: “Grounds of Mitigation (see overleaf).” Those grounds of mitigation are also similar, word for word. The appellants in sum say that they were first offenders who are remorseful and rehabilitated after spending time in custody; that they have learnt through pain that crime does not pay; that they are young unmarried men; that they were drunk during commission of the offence and suffered temporary insanity. For all that they pray that the appeal be allowed, their convictions be quashed and the sentences be reduced.",
            "4.When the appeal came up for hearing before us on a virtual platform on 7th March, 2022, both appellants were present while the office of Director of Public Prosecutions was represented by learned State Counsel, Miss Chelangat. Both appellants repeated what we have set out above grounds of appeal – that they have reformed; they have stayed long in prison, and that the sentence imposed be reduced.",
            "5.In her written submissions, Miss Chelangat stated that no issues of law or fact were raised in the mitigation offered by the appellants.",
            "6.The prosecution evidence established that the appellants armed themselves with a knife and a somali sword. They boasted to PW2 (Dickson Nyakal) that they would kill someone that day. They proceeded to carry out their threat – they fought the deceased, stabbing him with the said weapons. Doctor John Ombega (PW6) testified that on examining the body of the deceased he found a stab wound on the lower right hand rib which exited between the 6th and 7th rib. It measured 2.5 cm and was about 1.0 cm wide. The chest had a lot of blood and there was a cut wound on the left cheek. The cause of death was established to be excessive bleeding following the stab wound. The doctor further testified that both appellants were examined and found to be fit to stand trial.",
            "7.The trial Judge considered the defence of intoxication and found that the appellants were not intoxicated. The Judge found that there was a deliberate decision to go out and kill the deceased and after doing so the appellants went back and confirmed to PW2 what they had done. The Judge found that the defence of intoxication as defined by Section 207 of the Penal Code was not available to the appellants.",
            "8.We have considered the record and we too, like the trial Judge, have reached the same conclusion. The appellants armed themselves with dangerous weapons and they deliberately attacked the deceased inflicting fatal injuries on him. They have admitted in this appeal that they did so and they are asking to be forgiven for those acts.",
            "9.The appellants were sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for an offence which Section 204 of the Penal Code prescribed the death sentence. In their mitigation before the Judge the appellants said that they were remorseful; that they were young and had been in custody for long. The Judge considered those factors and applied the principles in Articles 23 and 26 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 on right to life and an interpretation of the Constitution that enhances rather than detracts from those rights. The Judge found that a life had been lost senselessly and reached the conclusion that we have seen.",
            "10.We cannot see any reason in law to interfere with those conclusions. This appeal has no merit, and we dismiss it accordingly."

        "judgement": [
            "1.The undated petition filed herein on 22nd April 2022, seeks review of sentence. The petitioner had been convicted in CMCCRC No. 1602 of 2010, of robbery with violence, and was given the mandatory death penalty. He proffered an appeal in HCCRA No. 21 of 2011, and the death sentence was reduced to twenty years imprisonment.",
            "2.The petition, no doubt, rides on the decision in Francis Karioko Muruatetu & another v Republic [2017] eKLR (Maraga CJ & P, Mwilu DCJ &VP, Ojwang, Wanjala, Njoki and Lenaola SCJJ), where the court appeared to lay down a general principle that all mandatory sentences were unconstitutional, and to allow trial and appellate courts discretion to revisit cases where mandatory sentences had been imposed, with a view to revising or reviewing them.",
            "3.The Supreme Court has since revisited the issue in Francis Karioko Muruatetu & another v Republic; Katiba Institute & 5 others (Amicus Curiae) [2021] eKLR (Koome CJ & P, Mwilu DCJ & VP, Ibrahim, Wanjala, Njoki, Lenaola & Ouko SCJJ), and clarified that its decision in Francis Karioko Muruatetu & another v Republic [2017] eKLR (Maraga CJ & P, Mwilu DCJ &VP, Ojwang, Wanjala, Njoki and Lenaola SCJJ) was of application only in murder cases, and not any other.",
            "4.The offence that the petitioner was convicted of was robbery with violence, as defined in section 296(2) of the Penal Code, Cap 63, Laws of Kenya. The decision in Francis Karioko Muruatetu & another v Republic [2017] eKLR (Maraga CJ & P, Mwilu DCJ &VP, Ojwang, Wanjala, Njoki and Lenaola SCJJ) is, therefore, of no application, and I have no discretion or jurisdiction to do that which the petitioner is inviting me to do.",
            "5.Even if the matter were fall within Francis Karioko Muruatetu & another v Republic [2017] eKLR (Maraga CJ & P, Mwilu DCJ &VP, Ojwang, Wanjala, Njoki and Lenaola SCJJ), it would still be something that does not fall within my mandate to address. Once a person is convicted, and exhausts his appeals, the execution of the sentence of imprisonment is the responsibility of the Executive, through the prison system. If the convict feels that he has sufficiently reformed, and need has arisen for his sentence to be reviewed or reduced or substituted, that remains the mandate of the Executive, through remission or the exercise of the prerogative of mercy. Even the decongestion exercises that the courts often engage in, are doe at the request of the Executive, through the Ministry responsible for prisons and other rehabilitative institutions. The role of the court is to impose sentence, and can only review the save on through the legal structures provided by the law, of appeal and revision, and by way constitutional petition, where there is abuse or violation of rights.",
            "6.In any event, the petitioner benefited from a review of sentence, when, on appeal, the Court of Appeal, albeit in exercise of a discretion it did not have, according to Francis Karioko Muruatetu & another vs. Republic; Katiba Institute & 5 others (Amicus Curiae) [2021] eKLR (Koome CJ & P, Mwilu DCJ & VP, Ibrahim, Wanjala, Njoki, Lenaola & Ouko SCJJ), set aside the death sentence imposed by the trial court and substituted it with a term of imprisonment. What the petitioner is inviting me to do has already been done by the Court of Appeal, and he should pursue administrative avenues for review of his sentence.",
            "7.The undated petition filed on 22nd April 2020 is, therefore, incompetent, and I hereby strike it out. Let copies of these proceedings be availed to George Onyango and to the Director of Public Prosecutions."
